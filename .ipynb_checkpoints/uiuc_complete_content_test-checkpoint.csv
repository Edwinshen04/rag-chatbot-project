Service and Storeroom Centers - Business & Finance,"Service and storeroom activities (service centers) are established to meet the programmatic needs of the academic community, and mainly provide goods or services to multiple internal users including sponsored programs. The University of Illinois System has a large number of service funds; therefore responsibilities, policies, and requirements have been established which service center funds and service center managers must adhere to. In addition, each service center is required to calculate and charge rates based on actual costs incurred and usage for the services and/or products they provide. These rates are charged against various university funds including sponsored projects. As a result, the calculations of these charges must comply with university, state, and federal costing principles. The Code of Federal Regulations (Uniform Guidance Title II CFR Part 200) provides guidelines that establish principles for determining costs applicable to grants, contracts, and other agreements with educational institutions. It also outlines the general federal requirements for calculating service rates. Federal agency Inspector General's audit plans have recently included reviews of service center costs. In addition, for our UIUC and UIC service centers, Section 3.2.0 of the Federal Cost Accounting Standards Disclosure Statement (DS-2) requires the university to provide information related to specialized service facilities and service centers. Following this requirement, we report various information to the federal government related to service centers with $1 million revenue and/or $250,000 in federal sponsored project revenue in our universities’ DS-2s. Service center managers must familiarize themselves with policies, procedures, and regulations they are required to follow when operating service centers. Click on the links listed below to access these regulations, etc. The links below provide departments and managers access to departmental center responsibilities, training, rate development principles, Business Objects Webi reports, and Excel templates. It is the service center managers' responsibility to ensure rate calculations are compliant, performed timely, and rates are published. However, on an annual basis the System Government Costing (SGC) identifies select service funds for rate reviews and approvals. There are a wide variety of service funds at the University of Illinois System. Each service center fund is its own business operation and many times contains multiple rates within each fund. In order for our staff to perform these rate reviews/calculations, they must work with each service center to obtain an understanding of their business operations.

Payments to Students - Business & Finance,"This information provides guidance to University of Illinois System units for making payments to students. The payment types below include detailed information and may consist of an introduction, reporting and regulatory requirements, processing instructions, and information for students. For the corresponding University of Illinois System policies pertaining to these payment types, see Policies and Procedures Manual, 8.10 Process Educational Payments to Students. University of Illinois System students may receive payment from the system for assistantships, awards, fellowships, grants, research support, scholarships, traineeships, travel, etc. The type, purpose, and primary beneficiary (student or University of Illinois System) of a payment determines how it is processed and whether it must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and/or the student’s university Financial Aid Office. If you are not sure which Payment Type should be used, please use the Payments to Students Selector Tool. Select the Payment Type and to expand the information and learn more. Assistantships or payments for teaching are considered compensation for services, and are paid by University Payroll and Benefits - refer to Payroll Transaction Processing for job aids and training materials. For Nonresident Aliens, Assistantships are reported on either IRS  Form 1042-S or Form W-2. Some units have funds used to pay students for participating in recruitment, public service, STEM promotion, or other activities that involve participant support costs. Though not related to employment services, these payments are taxable income to the recipient. The Banner account code used to pay participant costs is generally 149110. Policy reference: 8.6.12 Participant Support Costs. Participant Support Costs paid to U.S. citizen and resident alien students are reported by University Payables (UPAY) to the IRS and the recipient on  Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income. Participant Support Costs paid to non-resident aliens are reported by University Payroll and Benefits (UPB) to the IRS on Form 1042-S, Foreign Person’s U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding. A Social Security Number (SSN) is required for IRS Form 1099-MISC reporting. Therefore, payment of Participant Support Costs will be suspended if no valid SSN record exists in Banner. Before submitting payment requests, units are strongly encouraged to check Banner form SPAIDEN for asterisks in the SSN field and to instruct recipients whose SSN field is blank to present documentation of their SSN to their Registrar’s Office. U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Resident Aliens for tax purposes (Resident Aliens):
							Payments designated as Participation Support Costs are processed via Emburse Enterprise using the Participant Cost account code, including a comprehensive description with supporting documentation. When paying participant travel, use Participant Cost Other account code or non-employee travel, as directed by the funding source. Nonresident Aliens – Please refer to Non-Wage Payments for processing information, job aids and training materials. When making payments from gift funds (4M or 2G fund type) or university endowment income funds (4J fund type), units must be aware that the language used in donor fund agreements has varied over time. This can make interpretation of the language and restrictions as they apply to student payments difficult. The University of Illinois Foundation (UIF) has final authority in determining how UIF governing documents are interpreted. University Counsel has final authority in determining how estate gifts to the University of Illinois System are interpreted based on governing documents, such as donor will or trust. Once UIF or University Counsel has determined the true intent of the governing document(s), UIF’s or University Counsel’s interpretation must be enforced based on the definitions provided within each payment type listed on this webpage, not necessarily as worded in the governing document(s). For example, an older governing document may use the term “award”, whereas the true intent as determined by the UIF or University Counsel is a scholarship. Payments from this fund must therefore be processed as scholarships, not as awards. Since non-matriculated students are not yet enrolled in a degree program, the University of Illinois System has no U.S. Department of Education (ED) Title IV financial aid and no IRS Form 1098-T reporting requirements for these payments to non-matriculated students. Therefore, these payments are either: Recipients of student prizes or awards are typically selected through a contest, drawing, or competition. Students may also be selected in recognition of charitable, scientific, educational, artistic, literary, or civic achievements. Restrictions are typically not imposed on how a student can use prizes or awards. Thus, student prizes and awards are not restricted to educational purposes. If the funding source of the student prize or award is a gift or endowment income fund, then the donor may set the criteria for recipient selection but may not select the actual recipient(s). It is important to distinguish student prizes and awards from other types of payments to ensure proper financial statement reporting and compliance with the applicable Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reporting and withholding rules. Common examples of payments that are not student prizes and awards include: Prizes and awards are reported to the IRS and the recipient on Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income, by University Payables (UPAY). A SSN is required for IRS Form 1099-MISC reporting. Therefore, payment of prizes and awards will be suspended if no valid SSN record exists in Banner. Before submitting prize and award requests, units are strongly encouraged to check Banner form SPAIDEN for asterisks in the SSN field and to instruct recipients whose SSN field is blank to present documentation of their SSN to their Registrar’s Office. Note: the IRS imposes different tax requirements for Nonresident Alien recipients of prizes and awards; for details please visit Non-Wage Payments (login required) Prizes and awards are reported to the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) and considered a resource when determining the student's financial aid eligibility. Therefore, these payments may have an impact on the type and amount of financial aid the student is eligible to receive. OSFA will make the necessary adjustments to the student’s financial aid upon notification of the payments. These adjustments may create or increase a balance due on the student’s university account. Students are encouraged to view their Financial Aid Award letter and their billing statement periodically throughout the semester. The University of Illinois System's reporting responsibility with respect to Federal Student Aid (FSA) and any other financial assistance received by students is outlined in the FSA Administrative & Related Requirements (Chapter 3), specifically pages 2-33, ""Coordinating Official"". U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Resident Aliens for tax purposes (Resident Aliens) Prizes and awards paid to U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Resident Alien students are disbursed to the student's university account and will be applied to any outstanding charges on the student’s account unless the student or unit emails aroperations@uillinois.edu to request the prize or award be refunded to the student. Please refer to Non-Wage Payments (login required) for job aids and training materials. To ensure compliance with fund accounting and financial reporting requirements and any other applicable guidelines (such as donor intent), student prizes and awards should typically be recorded to Banner using: In addition, if the student prize or award is recorded to a Banner gift or endowment income fund, then it must comply with the donor’s intent. For gift cards or gift certificates presented to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and resident aliens equal to or greater than $200, the notification must be emailed to University Payables and the recipient’s campus Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA). For gift cards or gift certificates presented to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and resident aliens less than $200, the notification must be emailed to the recipient’s campus Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA). For security purposes, this information is sent using the Protected Email Attachment Application (PEAR) system. The PEAR email must include the dollar value, along with the student's name, UIN, address, and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). If unfamiliar with PEAR, consult the AITS PEAR Resource Page. Send the email to UPAY as well as the appropriate Financial Aid email listed below: For additional information, see Tax Implications for Payments. Gift cards or gift certificates presented to nonresident alien students are taxable, regardless of the amount. Therefore, whenever possible, process gifts to nonresident aliens as a prize or award using the Foreign National Payment e-Form, not as a gift card. If a gift card must be presented, report the gift amount on the Foreign National Payment e-Form together with the required documents for tax reporting purposes, especially the W-8BEN. Please refer to Non-Wage Payments (login required) for additional information. When offering a prize or award to a student, units are strongly encouraged to provide the following information to the recipient: Please see sample email template to send students who are U.S. Citizens or Resident Aliens for tax purposes, when offering them a prize or award. Please see sample email template to send students who are nonesident aliens for tax purposes, when offering them a prize or award. Many units have funds that may be used to pay student research and travel expenses. Before paying a student’s research and travel expenses, the unit must determine and document whether and why the student or the University of Illinois System is primary beneficiary of the payment. When the U of I System and the student seem to derive equal benefit, units are strongly encouraged to designate the student as primary beneficiary. Fellowships, scholarships, or grants paid directly to students for research experience programs are processed as fellowships as the student is the primary beneficiary. See Scholarships, Fellowships and Educational Assistance Grants for information on how to process. Example programs include: Payments made on behalf of students for travel, research, and related expenses who participate in these programs are processed through Emburse Enterprise as the U of I System is primary beneficiary of travel and research related payments. For fellowship payments to research experience/opportunity participants who are enrolled in the U of I System during the semester in which payment is made, the program code should roll up to NACUBO function 1788 (“Fellowships”). For fellowship payments to research experience/opportunity participants who are not enrolled in the U of I System during the semester in which payment is made, the program code should roll up to either NACUBO function 1100 (“Research”) when participants are engaged in official U of I System research activity, or to NACUBO function 1000 (“Instruction”) when participants are engaged in simulated research activity. UIUC – When paying UIUC students directly for participating in programs such as Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP), Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow (SURF), Summer Pre-Doctoral Institute (SPI), Research Experience and Mentoring (REM), Undergraduate Research and Mentoring, etc.): When paying U.S. Citizen and Resident Alien students for research and travel expenses that primarily benefit the student, these payments must be paid as a scholarship, fellowship or grant (see Scholarships, Fellowships and Educational Assistance Grants). The only exceptions to this rule are: Payments for these exceptions are submitted through Emburse Enterprise, iBuy, or University Payroll and Benefits (UPB) for student worker wages. When paying U.S. Citizen and Resident Alien students for research and travel expenses that primarily benefit the student, units must be aware of the following requirements: When paying Nonresident Alien students for research and travel expenses that primarily benefit the student, please refer to Non-Wage Payments (login required) for job aids and training materials. When paying students for research and travel expenses that primarily benefit the U of I System, payments must be processed via Emburse Enterprise including a clear and comprehensive description with supporting documentation of the U of I System business purpose and benefit. Research and travel payments that primarily benefit the U of I System are not reportable to the IRS as taxable income. All U of I System policies and procedures apply to these payments, including the requirement that payment or reimbursement requests be entered in Emburse Enterprise within 60 days of the date the expenditure was incurred, to avoid being reported to the IRS as taxable income. The unit is responsible for documenting why the U of I System is primary beneficiary, and retaining this documentation for audit purposes. As defined in IRS Publication 970 Tax Benefits for Education, scholarships, fellowships, educational assistance, and research grants are amounts paid to, or for the benefit of a student (whether an undergraduate, graduate, or professional student) at an educational institution to aid in the pursuit of their studies or related research. These payments typically support educational needs, such as tuition, fees, room, board, supplies, and travel where the primary purpose of the payment is to benefit the student’s education, academic development, or research. No past, present or future services that further the University of Illinois System’s mission are expected from the student in return for these payments, nor are students expected to repay the System for these scholarships, fellowships, educational assistance, and research grants. Scholarships, fellowships and educational assistance grants designated for qualified expenses (i.e., tuition and mandatory fees, books, or supplies) are not taxable income to the recipient. However, scholarship, fellowship and grant payments for unqualified expenses (e.g., room, board, travel, research, non-mandatory fees, books or supplies) are taxable income to the recipient. It is the student’s responsibility to determine and report to the IRS taxable scholarships, fellowships and/or grants received. Scholarship and grant recipients may be undergraduate, graduate or professional program students; fellowships are typically paid to graduate students, though there are exceptions (e.g., see Research Experience/Opportunity funds in the Research and Travel Payments section). If the scholarship, fellowship or educational assistance grant is funded by a gift, the donor may set the criteria for recipient selection but may not select the actual recipient(s). All scholarships, fellowships and grants paid to U.S. Citizen and Resident Alien students are reported to the IRS and the recipient on Form 1098-T, Tuition Statement, by University Bursar. A Social Security Number (SSN) is required for IRS Form 1098-T reporting. See IRS Publication 970 Tax Benefits For Education for additional information regarding taxability of these payments. Scholarships, fellowships and grants paid to Nonresident Alien students are not reported on Form 1098-T unless the student requests University Bursar to do so. However, with the exception of qualified scholarships, qualified fellowships, and W-2 reportable wages, all payments to Nonresident Alien students are reported to the IRS and the recipient on Form 1042-S, Foreign Person’s U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding, by University Payroll and Benefits (UPB). Withholding may be required on these payments. For additional information, see Payments to Foreign Nationals. All scholarships, fellowships and grants are reported to the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) and considered a resource when determining the student's financial aid eligibility. Therefore, these payments may have an impact on the type and amount of financial aid the student is eligible to receive. OSFA will make the necessary adjustments to the student’s financial aid upon notification of the payments. These adjustments may create or increase a balance due on the student’s university account. Students are encouraged to view their Financial Aid Award letter and their billing statement periodically throughout the semester. The university’s reporting responsibility with respect to Federal Student Aid (FSA) and any other financial assistance received by students is outlined in the FSA Administrative & Related Requirements (Chapter 3), specifically page 2-33, ""Coordinating Official"". Please refer to Non-Wage Payments (login required) for job aids and training materials. When offering a scholarship, fellowship or grant to a student, units are strongly encouraged to provide the following information to the recipient: Please see sample email template to send to students who are U.S. Citizens or Resident Aliens for tax purposes, when offering them a scholarship, fellowship or grant. Please see sample email template to send to students who are nonresident aliens for tax purposes, when offering them a scholarship, fellowship or grant. Purchasing tangible items for students (e.g., laptops, computers, iPads, tablets, research equipment, etc.) with value of $200 or more  is not allowed due to the complex tax, property accounting, and financial aid implications that may occur. Units that wish to use available resources to provide funding for the student to purchase tangible items over $200 must do so in the form of a Prize and Award  or Scholarship paid directly to the student account. Refer to the corresponding section on this page for instructions on how to process these payments. Purchasing tangible items for students (e.g., laptops, computers, iPads, tablets, research equipment, etc.) with a value of less than $200  is allowable up to unit discretion. To ensure proper classification for financial and tax reporting purposes, these types of purchases need to be classified as either a Prize and Award  (181700 expense account code, 1789 NACUBO function) or a Scholarship  (181100 expense account code, 1787 NACUBO function). All tuition and fee waivers paid to students who are not University of Illinois employees are processed through the Financial Aid Office. For payment of tuition and fee waivers to University of Illinois employees, see Tuition and Fees: Waivers, Departmental Payments, and Reimbursements. For information about the taxability of tuition and fees waivers, please go to Tuition and Fee Waivers. Please refer to Non-Wage Payments (login required) for job aids and training materials.

Student as Primary Beneficiary

Doctoral Dissertation Research Grants – The U of I System has determined that students are the primary beneficiaries of Doctoral Dissertation Research Grants such as the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DDRIG), even though the system also receives significant benefit from these grants.
Research Traineeships – Research Training Grants funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), graduate research fellowships funded by the American Heart Association (AHA), and other research training grants are educational grants, so the student recipients are primary beneficiary of these payments. Trainees must fulfill the research and teaching requirements as detailed by the grantors, but trainees do not perform services as student or system employees.
Scholarship/Fellowship Funds – When the source of research or travel payments is a fund designated for scholarships or fellowships, the student is primary beneficiary.

Example A: A student is asked to travel to a conference held in San Francisco to present a paper on behalf of a U of I System's department.
Example B: A student travels to Germany to perform research for the U of I System, which happens to be the same topic related to student B’s dissertation. The U of I System would perform research on this topic regardless of student B’s dissertation topic.
Example C: A student is asked to travel to New York City to represent the U of I System in a Scholastic Bowl competition (in this example, the student is not required to be employed by the unit paying for the travel).
Example D: A student submits a travel proposal in which the U of I System’s business purpose is effectively described, receives departmental approval that requires a clearly stated deliverable upon the student’s return, and the student presents that deliverable to the department’s satisfaction.
Example E: A student is asked to attend a conference or training that will enhance their knowledge and skills to effectively perform their university employment duties (e.g. student Orientation Leader).

Research expenses for human subject payments Wages paid to student workers Purchases of the U of I System property or equipment that retains functional value after the student’s research is complete and remains in the U of I System’s possession When making research and travel payments from sponsored research funds, receipts documenting the full amount of the expenses must be forwarded to Sponsored Programs Administration (SPA) Post-Award for UIUC students, or Grants & Contracts (GCO) for UIC and UIS students; sponsor funded travel and research expense payments may be delayed or reversed until or unless SPA Post-Award or GCO receives all necessary receipts. Research and travel expenses are not generally part of the student’s standard Cost of Attendance (COA) as established by OSFA in accordance with U.S. Department of Education (ED) guidelines; therefore, to minimize the risk of a travel or research scholarship or fellowship reducing the student’s eligibility for other financial aid, the unit must notify OSFA that the scholarship or fellowship is for travel or research expenses that exceed COA, and provide OSFA with a description of the expenses being covered by the scholarship or fellowship. Research and travel scholarships or fellowships are disbursed to the student's university account and will be applied to any outstanding balance on the student’s account unless he student or unit emails aroperations@uillinois.edu to request the scholarship or fellowship be refunded by direct deposited into the student’s bank account to pay the student’s travel or research expenses. Upon notifying students of scholarships and fellowships, units should inform the students that the scholarship or fellowship will be disbursed to the student’s university account, that it may impact the student’s other financial aid, and that the U of I System will report it to the IRS on Form 1098-T. If the unit requests aroperations@uillinois.edu to refund any scholarships or fellowships to students, the unit must also inform those students that they may still owe an outstanding balance on their student account which must be paid by the due date to prevent a financial hold of registration and transcripts. For scholarships, the Banner account code generally used is 181100, and the program code should generally roll up to NACUBO function 1787. For fellowships, the Banner account code used for educational expenses is 181300, the Banner account code used to pay living expenses is 281300, and the program code should generally roll up to NACUBO function 1788. When paying scholarships or fellowships from sponsored research funds, units must forward to Sponsored Programs Administration (SPA) Post-Award for UIUC students, or Grants & Contracts (GCO) for UIC and UIS students; sponsor funded travel and research expense payments may be delayed or reversed until or unless SPA Post-Award or GCO receives all necessary receipts. Because travel, research or emergency expenses are generally not part of the student’s standard Cost of Attendance (COA) as established by OSFA in accordance with ED guidelines, units must notify OSFA that the scholarship, fellowship or grant is for travel, research or emergency expenses that exceed COA, and provide a description of the expenses being covered by the scholarship, fellowship or grant. This will minimize the risk of the scholarship, fellowship or grant reducing other financial aid the student received. Because scholarships, fellowships or grants designated for travel, research or emergency expenses are disbursed to the student's university account, they will be applied to any outstanding charges on the student’s university account unless the student or unit emails aroperations@uillinois.edu to request the disbursement be refunded to pay the student’s travel, research or emergency expenses.

OSFA will make the necessary adjustment to the student’s financial aid award upon notification of the scholarship, fellowship or grant. This adjustment may create or increase a balance due on the student’s university account. The student is responsible for reviewing her/his Financial Aid Award letter and student account billing statement after the scholarship, fellowship or grant has been paid in order to understand the impact of the payment. All scholarships, fellowships and grants paid to U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Resident Aliens will be reported to the student and the IRS on Form 1098-T for the calendar year in which the payment was made. The University of Illinois System does not report Form 1098-T for Nonresident Aliens unless requested. Scholarships, fellowships and grants for unqualified expenses, i.e. room, board, travel, research, non-mandatory fees, books or supplies, are taxable income (refer student to IRS Publication 970). It is the student’s responsibility to determine and report to the IRS taxable scholarships, fellowships and/or grants received. When scholarships, fellowships or grants designated for travel, research or emergency expenses are disbursed to the student’s university account, they may be direct deposited to the student’s bank account if the student is enrolled in direct deposit and the student or unit emails aroperations@uillinois.edu to request disbursement be refunded to pay the student’s travel, research or emergency expenses. If the purchase is classified as a Prize and Award, and the student receives a cumulative value of $600 or more during the calendar year, the  Prize and award will be reported to the IRS and the recipient on Form 1099-MISC , Miscellaneous Income, by University Payables (UPAY). A SSN is required for IRS Form 1099-MISC reporting. Therefore, payment of prizes and awards will be suspended if no valid SSN record exists in Banner.

Headquarters and Travel Status - Business & Finance,"Employees are on travel status while away from official headquarters on authorized University of Illinois System business. Employees are not in travel status during their normal daily commute to and from work. When employees leave headquarters, their residence, or other authorized locations to go directly to their destination. When employees return directly to headquarters, their residence, or other authorized locations after completing system business. Official headquarters is where employees perform most of their duties, usually the area within the city limits. However, headquarters for employees at the University of Illinois Chicago is defined as the campus area. An employee's residence may be considered their official headquarters if their assigned duties require non-commuting travel every working day. The round-trip mileage between the employee's residence and headquarters. This is not a reimbursable expense. Travel mileage begins at an employee’s residence or headquarters depending on which one is closer to their destination. For example, John and Mary below traveled to the same destination. John's travel mileage began and ended at headquarters because he would have had to go to and from work that day even if he were not traveling.

Equipment Acquisitions - Business & Finance,"The University of Illinois System assumes the title to equipment that is acquired through purchase, constructed using U of I System funds, or received as a donation or transfer. All equipment must be recorded in the FABweb system, including Capital Development Board equipment. You do not have to include items in your departmental inventory in the following circumstances: Coding equipment and property, using the correct account code, is important because these codes affect many activities in the life cycle of the equipment. If account codes are incorrect, processing a new acquisition in FABweb, conducting biennial inventory for your unit, or responding to auditor questions will be difficult. If your unit purchased equipment through the requisition/purchase order process using a PCard, a standing order, direct pay, an equipment account code, or an initial record, an Original Tag (OTag) will be created in FABweb for you to complete. For an explanation of how equipment purchases are entered into FABweb, consult Equipment-Banner Tags Process Flow. For information about processing purchased equipment, consult the Business and Financial Policies and Procedures Manual, 12.1.5 Process a New Acquisition in FABweb. To value equipment, the initial purchase price of the equipment, along with all ancillary charges necessary to place the equipment into its intended location and condition it for use, need to be included in the final cost. These costs include things like shipping, installation, transit insurance, testing, professional fees, site preparation costs, trade-in-allowance, and training if it is required for initial use of the equipment. If any of these charges are on an invoice with multiple items, use the prorated amount based on the total invoice amount, adding the appropriate expenses to the related equipment and non-equipment expenses. Some ancillary charges such as installation may be charged to some equipment and not to others and excluded from supplies or consumables. Do not include finance charges, AppleCare, warranty expenses, or maintenance contracts in the cost valuation of the equipment as these items should be individually expensed to an appropriate non-equipment account code. Also refer to 12.1.3 Determine the Value of Equipment or Property. A non-cash addition is a term used to describe adding equipment to Banner inventory that has a fair market value of $2500 or greater and is not acquired in exchange for cash. Since there is no invoice payment, no Otag is created in the normal purchasing process, and the equipment will not automatically appear in the unit’s FABweb new acquisitions. Therefore, you must request this addition to inventory using a link in FABweb. Property Accounting will manually add the non-cash addition to Banner inventory. Common examples of non-cash additions include: For additional information about all non-cash additions consult policies 12.1.7 Identify Donated, Found, and Other Non-Cash Addition Equipment and 12.1.8 12.1.8 Add Donated, Found, and Other Non-Cash Addition Equipment to FABweb. If your unit has received equipment from the surplus warehouse, you will receive a notification email that the transfer has been completed. If the equipment obtained from the Surplus Warehouse is at or above the inventory threshold of $2,500, the tracked equipment has already been transferred to your unit equipment inventory. You must update the attributes for that inventoried item in FABweb. Important attributes for this type of update include updating location, custodian, equipment manager, and condition code. If the equipment has an Entity code associated with it, this will either need to be updated or removed. For additional information, consult policy 12.2.4 Maintain Entity Codes for Self-Supporting Activities. To learn how to completes transfers of equipment from one unit to another in FABweb, please consult the following resources: Equipment purchased with certain sponsored project funds (grants, contracts, gifts, or federal appropriations) may be titled to or owned by the sponsoring agency and the University of Illinois System is the temporary custodian of that equipment used for research purposes.

Cash Handling - Business & Finance,"Cash is a crucial asset for the University of Illinois System, requiring clear accountability in its receipt, deposit, and custodianship due to its sensitive nature. The U of I System adopts a decentralized approach to cash handling, delegating responsibilities extensively to enhance operational efficiency, convenience, and flexibility. The ultimate responsibility for the cash handling function lies with the Vice President/Chief Financial Officer and Comptroller. Delegations extend to units not under the direct control of the Vice President. Effective delegation relies on vigilant supervision by unit managers. Adequate internal controls play a pivotal role in ensuring responsible stewardship of public funds and safeguarding employees. The cash handling function encompasses two main areas: Unit Heads play a pivotal role in ensuring the secure and accountable management of cash within their respective units. Their responsibilities encompass the following key aspects: 506 South Wright Street

iBuy - Business & Finance,"iBuy is an online marketplace for purchasing goods and services at the University of Illinois System. It combines the use of Internet technology with procurement best practices to simplify the purchasing process and reduce costs. iBuy presents an easy, user-friendly shopping experience, allowing users to shop on-line, select items, place items in an electronic shopping cart, and submit their requisition. All users requesting access to iBuy will need to have it provisioned via Security Application. This process will follow the standard system access protocol with users reaching out to their Unit Security Contact (USC) with an access request. Those employees who currently use PCards and/or requisition/approve purchases in Banner are prime candidates to use iBuy. However, any University of Illinois System employee involved with procuring goods and services in the course of official system business may also use iBuy. This includes faculty, staff, and even student employees, such as lab and research assistants. Once those employees who will use iBuy have been identified, the next step is to determine roles as appropriate (see below). Best Practice Tip: Decentralize transactional activity to the organizational level at which purchasing decisions are actually made. iBuy's ease of use, workflow functionality, and reporting capability are well-suited to support such decentralization. Departmental approvals are one aspect of iBuy's overall approval process. As such, it is a control point that deserves attention as departments begin using iBuy. When assigning Approvers, departments should consider which staff will be responsible for reviewing and approving the orders of others on a routine basis. Such users should be given sufficient approval authority to handle approving the most common orders. In addition, consider who will need to look at larger orders and provide those users with a higher level of approval authority. A hierarchy of approval levels will allow for appropriate allocation of workload while ensuring that large purchases are presented for review by more senior or experienced staff. The following approval queues are available for departmental use: $0 - $4,999 (Optional)
$5,000 - $9,999 (Optional)
$10,000 - $49,999
$50,000 - $249,999
$250,000 - $499,999
$500,000 - $999,999
$1,000,000+ Note: Departments are strongly encouraged to use the $5000 - $9999 queue; those departments that choose not to use this queue subject all of their departmental Requestors and Department Account Coders to Statements of Economic Interests reporting requirements. iBuy Approvers (with the exception of those that are included in the $0 - $4999 queue only) may be required to file as well. Best Practice Tip: Include at least two individuals in each approval queue to address the possibility of unplanned absences. There are certain combinations of roles within iBuy that are not allowed. Please see iBuy Access: iBuy Role Matrix to review role compatibility. There are Internal Controls that prohibit certain role combinations of roles between iBuy, Fabweb and Biennial Inventory. Additional information can be found at Internal Controls: Prohibited Role Combinations and iBuy Access: Internal Controls - iBuy Roles Explained Each user in iBuy has specific roles that define what the user is able to do in the system. Below are the definitions that might help you better understand iBuy roles. Can do everything necessary to create a requisition and submit it for approval EXCEPT adding C-FOAPAL information.

Invoices are submitted into iBuy in several different ways - cXML, supplier portal, email, Digital Mailroom, and manual – and are linked to an iBuy purchase order. The invoice can be digital information only, or a .pdf invoice image may be attached to the iBuy invoice. Invoices route through current iBuy workflow; if any issues are identified in workflow, the unit will be notified. Once approved, iBuy invoices export to Banner for payment processing iBuy integrates with Banner, which remains the university's financial system of records. Purchase order numbers in iBuy are generated in Banner EXCEPT when the purchase is made with an internal vendor (iBuy PO number). iBuy users can enter full CFOAPALs or Index codes to allocate purchase costs. The codes available in iBuy will be synchronized with and validated against those available in Banner. Purchase orders created in iBuy encumber the selected funds in Banner EXCEPT when the purchase is made with an internal vendor. University Payables processes all payments against purchase orders created in iBuy EXCEPT when the purchase is made with an internal vendor. In the latter case, the internal vendor processes a charge back to the FOAPAL(s) provided in the iBuy purchase order. Encumbrances and payments based on iBuy purchase orders appear in the standard financial reports generated out of Banner. Must be established in Banner to be used in iBuy. A vendor must be established as an e-procurement vendor in Banner to be used in iBuy. When searching on a non-catalog form, if you cannot find the vendor you are searching for, please review the job aids for assistance. For catalog items, iBuy automatically provides commodity codes to Banner. For non-catalog items, users need to select the appropriate commodity code from the Commodity Codes. iBuy's History tab gives users the ability to search on requisitions and/or purchase orders created against their Banner Chart and Level 5 (3-digit) Organization code, e.g., Chart 9 - Organization 123. Searches can key on: And there are multiple ways to filter search results, including date parameters and the current status of the requisition/purchase order. Whether as public (meaning it's available to any iBuy user) or private (meaning it's only available to the user who created it), any search performed in History can be saved as a query to streamline any future use of that particular search. Users also have the option to export the results of History searches or queries as CSV (comma separated values) files into other applications, such as Excel. This feature offers a simple, straightforward way to integrate other tools outside of iBuy in order to enhance further users' ability to track, evaluate, and report their spending.

Q: Can we upload all receipts as one combined PDF for all expenses listed on the ER? A: There are two places you can attach receipts: at the header level and on the individual expense line items. Documentation that applies to the whole expense report (approvals, travel plans, emails, etc.) should be uploaded to the header. Receipts that apply to each individual expense should be attached to the expense line. If you are unable to provide a receipt, do not attach any documents to the line item so that it is flagged as a missing receipt. Proof of payment (if required) should be attached to the header. Q: How can I submit my receipts with my mobile? A: Use the CR Snap app on your mobile phone to take a photo of the receipt. It will automatically upload to your eWallet.

It will also be available during the first couple weeks at the beginning of the fiscal year, when there are two fiscal years open. Q: Can I split charges to multiple FOPALS? A: Yes, charges can be split to multiple FOPALS. When adding allocations to your report select the options to add an allocation. The system will automatically split the expense by equal percentages, but these percentages can be modified. Additionally, allocations can be split by dollar amount. However, State and Local funds cannot be combined. Q: How will my DCM manage our department cards? A: DCMs will manage the Purchasing Card (PCard) and Travel Card (TCard) in the same manner they currently manage the cardholder (CH) profiles. For PCard, they will use the PCard Web Solutions. For TCard, the Travel Card Solution. Q: Are there EDDIE reports for Emburse Enterprise? A: Yes, there are many standard reports in EDDIE.

A: If you need to add a note, upload a document or delete a line item, this can be done in Returned status. The original submit date remains the same.

How do I edit items in the header? A: Choosing the correct responses in the header drop-downs is very important as these determine the rest of the ER (ex choosing PCard as the Purchase Type only allows PCard tiles to be available). Once the header is complete and an expense line is added, the account code has been determined. To make corrections to the header, the expense lines will need to be deleted; then the header will be available to edit. Q: When will Payables review my expense report? A: ERs are reviewed in order by document submit date. Please see the Payables Processing Status page to see what date we are currently working on. You can find a link to the page on your Emburse Enterprise dashboard. Q: My report has been returned with instructions to submit a Payable’s exception. How do I do that?
