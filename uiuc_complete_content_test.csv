Instructions for how vendors can submit purchase order invoices are available on the Information for Vendors page. Processing Banner/BDM Purchase order (PO) invoices and credit memos are scanned and loaded into Banner Document Management (BDM) for processing by the Invoice Processing Center. Due to the daily volume received (approximately 1,300 documents per day), this process could take up to 5 business days. Invoices are reviewed by University Payables (UPAY) and processed by receipt/load date, oldest to newest, in accordance with the terms of the PO. The current BDM processing date is posted daily on the Payables Processing Status page. Units can search the invoices and credit memos in BDM by vendor invoice number, PO number, or invoice amount. Once a UPAY team member has started processing an invoice or credit memo in Banner, the unit can view the document in Banner FOIDOCH as well. Transition to iBuy Starting May 15, 2025, select non-catalog invoices will be available exclusively in iBuy. Current invoice submission and processing will be moved from Banner/BDM to iBuy in phases, with the goal of all non-catalog invoices loaded and processed in iBuy. Documentation for invoices previously processed in Banner/BDM will remain in BDM for review. iBuy The Digital Mailroom will scan and load invoices and credit memos into iBuy within 48 hours of receipt. iBuy documents will route through established iBuy invoice workflow. If a PO or invoice issue is identified, the invoice will route to a UPAY approval queue for review, and UPAY will contact the unit via an iBuy Comment for further assistance. All approved iBuy invoices and credit memos will export to Banner for payment issuance. Payment Payment is issued in accordance with the terms of the PO. Payment methods include ACH/direct deposit, wire transfer, ePayables (virtual credit card payments), and paper check. Once issued, payment information is available in Banner FOIDOCH or Banner FAIVNDH, and payment information will populate in iBuy in the Payment Information section of the invoice or credit memo. Unpaid/Rejected Invoices UPAY priority is to process complete and accurate invoices in the open queue. If a unit or vendor submits an invoice for payment and that invoice does not appear in Banner, current technology does not allow units to be notified when an invoice is rejected. However, units can search in BDM by the vendor's invoice number, invoice date and/or the invoice amount. If the vendor invoice has rejected, the Banner Invoice Number ('I' number in BDM) will be INVREJCT. Invoices scanned and loaded into BDM may be rejected for various reasons: Duplicate vendor invoice number Duplicate invoice submittal PO number is inaccurate or incomplete PO is closed or cancelled If a unit finds that an invoice has been rejected, they should: Review the invoice to determine the missing or incorrect information (you can find a list of what information should be on an invoice under ""Submitting Invoices"" on the Information for Vendors page) The most common reasons why invoices are rejected include: duplicate vendor invoice number purchase order is closed highlighted information, red ink or red text (which often cannot be read by scanning equipment) Email obfsupay@uillinois.edu with the correct information and the invoice will be processed according to the PO terms. For access to BDM, please contact your Unit Security Contact (USC). For additional information about BDM, please review the job aids, Banner Document Management (BDM) Basics . Invoices on Hold or in Process There are instances where invoices may be put on hold due to lack of necessary information or if they do not match their corresponding PO. The most common reasons for invoices to be put on hold are tolerance issues or vendor ID or remittance address issues. For BDM invoices, an automated email will be sent to the unit (see below). For iBuy invoices, the unit will receive an email based on an iBuy Comment on the iBuy invoice. Automated and Manual Email Codes UPAY sends automated emails for the majority of BDM invoice holds. Those emails are driven by the hold code entered in the UREF1 field in BDM, and are sent to the PO requestor, unit financial manager, and the appropriate Purchasing office. Automated Email Codes D-DUPSHIP: This invoice appears to be a duplicate shipment D-ITMADD: This invoice contains a line item(s) which does not appear on the purchase order. D-OVR50K: University Payables must have a unit email approval for all invoices over $50,000 on a standing order D-OVRTOL: The invoice amount exceeds the amount remaining on the PO. For Banner regular orders and iBuy standing orders, the invoice will be processed for payment unless an invoice line exceeds the corresponding PO line by either 10% or $150 when the lower threshold of the two is exceeded. Banner standing orders are subject to the same thresholds but are evaluated on the PO total. D-PRICE: This invoice contains a line item(s) which does not match the price(s) listed on the purchase order D-SUB: This invoice contains a line item(s) which appears to be a substitutions(s) for a commodity listed on the purchase order D-UOM: This invoice contains a line item(s) which appear to be of a different unit of measure than that listed on the purchase order D-WRGPO: The purchase order referenced on invoice is assigned to another vendor P-WRGVID: This purchase order references an incorrect vendor ID D-OVRBID: This is a Bid Order and requires buyer approval P-FRTNA: FOB terms on the purchase order do not allow payment of freight charges D-NONCONF: Invoice, order, shipping, service date occurs before the purchase order transaction date D-IBUYFR: Invoiced freight amount exceeds the iBuy PO amount D-EXPST: Expired state funds U-WIRE: A wire transfer payment may be required There are instances where UPAY must provide more specific information to the originating unit, and manual emails are constructed and sent. Units are encouraged to respond to these emails rather than beginning a new email string so that UPAY can identify these responses and efficiently forward to the appropriate group for processing. Manual Email Codes D-POCAN: The purchase order has been cancelled D-POCL: The purchase order is closed P-INCPO: The purchase order is incomplete P-NEWFYPO: The purchase order referenced on the invoice is expired. Please provide a current valid PO number. D-CREDIT: Hold for credit or to determine the validity of credit D-VIF: New vendor information form is needed D-DPTREQ: Invoice placed on hold per department request U-APISSUE: Invoice has an issue that needs to be handled by UPAY U-EFFROLL: PO needs to roll to next fiscal year before payment can be made U-P&D Address on invoice needs to be added to vendor record D-BOT: Increase of PO needs approval by the Board of Trustees Training Banner Document Management Basics Related Links Information for Vendors Electronic Invoicing Special Payment Requests iBuy Resource Page Banner information Policies 8 Payments and Reimbursements Business and Finance For questions or concerns about the BusFin site, please contact sharedservices@uillinois.edu.

CFOAPAL Accounting Strings To help maintain a financial reporting structure that can be consistently used across the U of I System, a chart of accounts, or an “accounting string”, was developed for all units to report their financial activity. The accounting string used at the U of I System is called a C-FOAPAL string. Reconciliations Units must regularly monitor and reconcile their financial activity within Banner. See the information, resources, and tools in this section to assist you as you develop and carry out your reconciliation processes. Journal Vouchers Journal Vouchers are non-cash transactions used to process accounting entries within Banner. Units must ensure that all JVs are processed accurately and on a timely basis. This helps ensure accurate reporting for the University of Illinois System’s audited financial statements. Payroll Accounting University Accounting and Financial Reporting (UAFR) is responsible for overseeing payroll accounting functions. Explore this section to learn more about payroll accounting responsibilities and processes. Year-End Procedures It is important that personnel responsible for the business and financial activity of units carefully review all policies, procedures and critical dates for fiscal year opening and closing processes available in this section.

This accounting system commonly used by non-profit and governmental organizations emphasizes accountability (not profitability) to ensure proper stewardship of financial resources as well as compliance with applicable regulations, guidelines, and restrictions associated with the various funding sources that the University of Illinois System receives. For more details, see Section 13.1, Overview of University Fund Accounting within the Business and Financial Policies and Procedures . To help maintain a financial reporting structure that can be consistently used across the U of I System to ensure accurate financial reporting and compliance with fund accounting principles, a chart of accounts, or an “accounting string”, was developed for all system units report their financial activity. C-FOAPAL Accounting String Segment Codes The accounting string used at the U of I System is called a C-FOAPAL string. See the information below for further details on what each segment of the C-FOAPAL accounting string represents. C = Chart The chart code is a one-digit code for the applicable university or System Office that the accounting string belongs to. There are four chart codes – see below for an explanation of what each code represents: Chart 1 = University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Chart 2 = University of Illinois Chicago Chart 4 = University of Illinois Springfield Chart 9 = University of Illinois System Offices F = Fund The fund code is a six-digit code which identifies the funding source of the financial resources for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Financial resources received by the U of I System need to be recorded in separate fund types to denote the funding source, with each fund type having a different purpose depending on the revenue. For example, financial resources received from state appropriations would be credited to a state fund, while financial resources received from donors would be credited to a gift fund. O = Organization The organization code (also commonly referred to as an “org” code) is a six-digit code that represents which unit owns and is fiscally responsible for that specific accounting string. The first three digits of the organization code typically designates the college, department, or unit that owns the organization code, while the subsequent three digits further classify the code’s ownership (such as to a particular department within a college, etc.) A = Account The account code is either a five-digit code (for the general ledger) or a six-digit code (for the operating ledger) that designates a transaction as an expense, revenue, transfer, asset, or liability. Proper account code usage is crucial for accurate financial reporting and state reporting requirements. For further details on this important segment of the C-FOAPAL accounting string, refer to UAFR’s dedicated Banner Account Codes webpage. P = Program The program code is a six-digit code that has a variety of important financial reporting implications, including the classification of expense transactions to the proper “function” (or purpose) according to standard definitions developed by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO). This code also helps distinguish between a unit’s operational activities within fund types that may record multiple activities in a single fund (e.g., state, institutional, self-supporting, service plan, and federal agricultural research funds). For further details on this important segment of the C-FOAPAL accounting string, refer to UAFR’s dedicated Overview of Banner Program Codes & NACUBO Functions webpage. A = Activity (Optional) The activity code is an optional three-digit or six-digit code that may be used to track specific financial activities or projects. For example, if Professor A has three different projects taking place within a particular C-FOAP accounting string, then that professor may want to assign separate activity codes to each of the three separate activities in order to segregate out the financial transactions for each project. A list of Generic Activity Codes are open for use by any department and for any purpose. However, if you would like to request a new activity code specifically for your department to use, then you may request a new unique code as well. Finally, keep in mind that Banner does not require activity codes on financial transactions. Be aware if you do use activity codes, there is always a risk of financial transactions posting without the activity code assigned. For example, if the user forgot to include the activity code on a journal voucher transaction. L = Location (Optional) The location code is an optional six-digit code that is primarily used (but not limited to) the Fixed Asset module. This code designates the physical location, such as a building and room number of an asset (such as a piece of furniture owned by the U of I System). Other Codes See below for an explanation of other helpful codes. While these codes are not necessarily a part of the standard C-FOAPAL accounting string, it is helpful to know what they represent. Index Code (Optional) The index code is an optional six-digit code that may be used to conserve keystrokes when typing out the full C-FOAPAL accounting string (such as within a journal voucher). For example, if a unit frequently completes journal vouchers which use the same chart, fund, organization, and program code, then the user may want to establish an index code that will quickly fill in those C-FOP segments when they are completing their journal voucher. Instead of having to manually type in each one of these segment codes, they can request the establishment of a six-digit index code to use instead. Once UAFR establishes the index code at the unit’s request, the user can enter that six-digit index code into the applicable field of the journal voucher page, and the applicable chart, fund, organization, and program code will automatically default into the journal voucher page. This saves the user quite a few keystrokes, and helps eliminate the possibility of a typing error. Also, all index codes which are tied to either a state or federal work study fund will be updated automatically on July 1 each year to reflect the new fiscal year’s fund code. So, there would be no need for the unit to request a new index code in those scenarios. Who to Ask For further details, contact the applicable subject matter experts listed in the Who to Ask list.

For example, financial resources received from donors would be classified into a gift fund, while financial resources received from State of Illinois appropriations would be classified in a state fund. Classifying these various types of financial resources into separate fund types also helps us properly monitor these financial resources which have been appropriated, awarded, contributed, earned, and entrusted to the U of I System for proper stewardship. For example, each funding source may have different sets of restrictions and guidelines which must be followed. By separating these funding sources into different fund types, we are better able to monitor compliance with those various restrictions and guidelines. Commonly Used Fund Types See below for a short list of fund types that are commonly used across the U of I System. State Funds This fund type (primarily fund type 1A) resides in the 1000YY – 1800YY numerical range, with YY representing the applicable fiscal year. State funds are primarily generated from state appropriation revenue as well as revenue from tuition and certain types of fees (such as mandatory fees) assessed to students. For further details regarding state funds, visit the State Funds webpage. Administrative Allowance Funds This fund type (2A) resides in the 2002nn numerical range. These funds are generated from administrative allowance assessments charged to other fund types, such as self-supporting funds. For further details regarding administrative allowance funds, visit the Administrative Allowance Funds webpage. Indirect Cost Recovery (ICR) Funds This fund type (2C) has one primary fund code number (200250). This fund code is used across the entire system, which each unit denoting their slice of this fund using their unit-specific organization and program code. These funds are generated from indirect cost assessments charged to grant funds. For further details regarding ICR funds, visit the ICR Funds webpage. Self-Supporting Funds This type of fund (which is accounted for in the 3Q, 3E, 3J, and 3M fund types) resides in the 300000 – 399999 numerical range and is comprised of revenue generated from the sale of goods and services to all types of customers. For further details regarding self-supporting funds, visit the Self-Supporting Funds webpage. Gift Funds This fund type (4M) resides in the 620000 – 639999 numerical range and is comprised of gift revenue received via contributions from external donors.

To classify a general ledger transaction to the proper asset (5nnnn) or liability (6nnnn) account code within Banner for financial reporting purposes. To classify expense transactions to the proper Statewide Accounting Management System (SAMS) code per state reporting requirements. To ensure accuracy and clarity in a unit’s financial statements which allows unit management to clearly see the types of expenses that were incurred, the type of revenue that was earned, the types of fund transfers that were processed, and the types of assets and liabilities that are on the books. This type of detailed information can ensure unit management has accurate information on hand which can aid them when making budgeting and financial planning decisions, as well as when reconciling and reviewing past data. Given the impact that account codes have on the University of Illinois System’s financial reporting processes, it is very important to ensure that accurate account codes are assigned to your various Banner transactions. Account Code Search The Account Code Search application allows you to identify the proper account code to use on your various transactions. This application provides the full details behind each account code, such as: The full account code title, along with the shortened Banner title The account code description, which provides the definition Examples of common uses of the account code Details regarding scenarios when the account code should not be used Tips on Using the Application Use the Lookup section of the Code Search tab to search for a specific account code.

To classify expenses within a standard reporting structure established by NACUBO. To separate financial activities by department or activity when using funds that are shared across the University of Illinois System. Such as state or Indirect Cost Recovery (ICR) funds, or when using funds that have multiple activities occur within one fund (e.g., self-supporting or service plan funds). NACUBO Functions The National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) has established functions to create a standard reporting structure for accurately classifying expense activity according to the purpose for which the costs were incurred. These functional classifications are assigned to Banner program codes and indicate why an expense was incurred, as opposed to what was purchased like an account code, or where the funding came from like a fund code. For example, if a unit purchases research supplies, the program code (along with the NACUBO function assigned to that program code) would indicate that the expense was tied to the University of Illinois System’s research mission, while the account code would indicate that the expense was a consumable supply and the fund code would indicate the funding source for the expense. These functional classifications have been widely used for decades by both public and independent institutions and are required to use these functional classifications when reporting expense information in various types of financial reports. This helps donors, granting agencies, creditors, and other readers of the financial statements understand the various mission-related activities of the institution. Given that so many reports and external parties are dependent on these functional expense definitions (which have been in place for decades), we must keep these definitional standards and accounting structures in place to ensure consistency in reporting from year-to-year. Thus, given the importance of NACUBO functions, any accounting information system used by the University of Illinois System must be capable of producing expense information by these NACUBO functional classifications. Banner has this capability, which we will touch on in the following section. Importance of Proper NACUBO Function Coding Accurately assigning the proper NACUBO function to Banner program codes is critical to help ensure accurate financial and activity-related reporting of UI System expenditure activities. See below for a few examples of the various financial reports, activity-related reports, accounting processes, computations, and rankings which rely on accurate coding of NACUBO functions: Annual audited financial statements; Reporting to the State Comptroller; Reporting to the University of Illinois System’s Board of Trustees; Reporting to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), which is used for benchmarking by higher education institutions and the federal government; Assignment of costs in our Activity Reporting System, which is used for reporting to the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE); Reporting from the IBHE to the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) which utilizes this information during the state appropriation budgeting process; Assignment of costs in campus grant cost accounting systems, which are used to allocate costs and determine overhead recovery rates; Reporting to major research sponsors; and National rankings of the nation’s top universities and colleges (such as annual rankings that take place within the U.S. News & World Report publication). How to View NACUBO Functions Assigned to Existing Program Codes in Banner NACUBO functions may be identified by viewing a program code’s hierarchy using Banner page FTIPRGH . The user would need to filter on the chart and program code and would then need to execute the query by clicking on the Go button. The form will then display all of the predecessor codes for the specified program code, including the level one code (which represents the assigned NACUBO function). Another popular Banner page that can be used is FZMPROG . The user can filter on the applicable chart and program code number of the program code in question, and then click on the Go button to bring up the basic information on that program code. The NACUBO function can typically be found in the Predecessor Program field. Numerical Format of Departmental Program Codes Some fund types (such as state, ICR, administrative allowance, and self-supporting funds) are required to use departmental program codes (as opposed to generic program codes, which is covered in the next section). This is required for two primary reasons: To separate financial activities between departments who share the same fund code. For example, when a specific fund code (such as the 1000YY state fund or the 200250 ICR fund) is widely used by various units across the University of Illinois System, units must use their own specific organization and program code with the shared fund code to distinguish their financial activity from other departments. To separate financial activities within an individual fund code. For example, when a specific fund code is limited to a specific department (such as a self-supporting fund), there may be times when that fund code has several different activities taking place within it (such as a self-supporting fund used to account for several different conferences). By using a departmental program code, the unit is able to separate these activities within the same fund code, which allows for more clarity in the financial reporting process. A departmental program code can be identified by the numerical format. The first three digits of a departmental program code will agree to the unit’s three-digit organization code. The final three digits would be sequentially assigned in numerical order. For example, if a unit’s three-digit organization code was 223, then the departmental program codes would follow a numerical format such as 223001, 223002, 223003, and so on, where each individual program code represents a different financial activity. Numerical Format of Generic Program Codes Some fund types (such as current restricted and non-current fund types) require generic program codes in the 19nnnn numerical range, since funding within these fund types are not shared by multiple departments or activities. A common example would be a gift fund (which is a current restricted fund from a financial reporting perspective). Since these generic program codes are within the 19nnnn numerical range, they differ from the departmental organization-specific program codes in that they would not begin with the unit’s three-digit organization code. Instead, these generic program codes begin with “ 19 ” and end with a four-digit code that reflects the applicable NACUBO function. For example, 191100 is the generic program code for research (where the last four digits of 1100 represent the research NACUBO function as outlined in Appendix 4). So, if a gift fund was used to primarily pay for research expenditures, we would expect to see a generic 191100 program code used on that gift fund’s research expenditures. How to Request the Creation of a New Program Code To request the creation of a new program code, complete UAFR’s Banner Fund, Program, Index Code Request Form , which is located on Accounting and Budgeting Forms webpage. When completing this form, be sure to complete the following sections from the FPI Code Request tab with as much detail as possible. General Information Request a New Program Code Submitted By Importance of Transparent Titles for Departmental Organization-Specific Program Codes In addition to following the proper numerical format and assigning the proper NACUBO function, it is also important to have a clear and transparent title assigned to departmental organization-specific program codes. By assigning a clear and transparent title, it is easier to identify how the program code should ultimately be used and will help ensure the program code is used for activities that are consistent with the program code’s assigned NACUBO function. For example, if a departmental organization-specific program code will be primarily used for Professor A’s research activities, then the program code should be assigned with an 1100 Research NACUBO function along with title that is consistent with that purpose, and which properly reflects the assigned NACUBO function (such as “Professor A – Research”). Importance of Using a Program Code Consistently for the Same Purpose from Year-to-Year It is important to use a program code consistently from year-to-year for the same purpose as which it was established. This helps with variance analysis from year-to-year and preserves the original use of the program code from a historical financial reporting perspective. For example, if a program code was originally established five years ago for research purposes, then that program code must remain coded and used for research purposes for the rest of the program code’s life. The purpose and function of the program code cannot be changed to a different activity or function once it has been properly established. Allowability of NACUBO Function Changes on Existing Program Codes Typically, it is unallowable to change the purpose of a program code. If the natural life of a program code has been completed, then the program code will need to be terminated and a new program code established to account for any new activity. It is unallowable to reuse an old program code for new activity. However, if an error was made at the time of the program code’s creation which caused an incorrect NACUBO function to be assigned, then it would be allowable to correct the assigned NACUBO function on that program code, if the activity posting to that program code has remained the same since inception. For example, if a unit submits a request to create a new program code, asking that it be used for research purposes, but the program code was mistakenly assigned a NACUBO function for another purpose (such as instruction), then it would be allowable in that instance for UAFR to change the NACUBO function to research, assuming that the unit has used the program code for research activities since its inception as they initially requested. How to Request a Change to an Existing Program Code To request an edit to an existing program code (such as to request a title change), simply email UAFR at uas@uillinois.edu detailing your request. One of the subject matter experts from UAFR’s program codes team will then investigate your request and let you know if there are any questions or concerns before processing it. NACUBO Function Assignments on Cost Share Program Codes If a program code is being used to track a hard match cost share or contributed effort cost share on a sponsored project, the NACUBO function assigned to the cost share program code typically needs to match the NACUBO function assigned to the default program code of the related grant fund. The reason for this is due to the fact that the NACUBO function impacts the government costing study allocation, which determines the F&A rates used for indirect cost assessments on sponsored projects. Allowable Fund Type & NACUBO Function Combinations Given the nature and funding source of the various types of funds utilized in the University of Illinois System, there are limitations on which types of funds can be used with certain NACUBO functions. See the NACUBO Function & Allowable Fund Type Combinations grid for further details on which NACUBO functions are appropriate to use within a given fund type. How to Request the Termination of a Program Code Which is No Longer Needed If you have a program code which you no longer need, email UAFR at uas@uillinois.edu asking to terminate the program code. Once UAFR reviews the request and ensures that there are no further issues that need addressed (such as open jobs, payroll positions, index codes, balances, etc. which are still tied to the program code), they will then proceed with terminating the program code in Banner.

For example, once a code is terminated, future transactions will no longer be able to post to that code, removing the risk of misclassified transactions posting to these unused codes. After unused codes are identified and terminated, it will save time and effort in future monthly reconciliations, as those terminated codes will no longer have to be reviewed. For those who manage self-supporting or service plan funds, terminating an unused self-supporting or service plan fund prior to the year-end deadline ensures that you will no longer have to complete and submit a Year-End Fact Sheet for those terminated funds. Note : Given that the chart and account codes within the C-FOAPAL accounting string are used uniformly across the entire University of Illinois System, those are typically not codes that units would ever request to have terminated. Any analysis and termination of those codes are handled within University Accounting & Financial Reporting (UAFR) internally. So, that is why those codes are not addressed within this webpage.

First, go to the applicable code maintenance page within Banner as outlined below: Fund Codes: FZMFUND Organization Codes: FZMORGN Program Codes: FZMPROG Activity Codes: FTMACTV Index Codes: FZMACCI Perform a query (by pressing the F7 button or by clicking on the “Filter” icon in Banner) within this page, searching on the applicable chart and code combination. Once you execute the query (by pressing the F8 button or by clicking on the “Go” icon in Banner), look for the Termination Date field. If that field is empty, then that means the code is active. If that field has a date within it, then that means the code was terminated on that date shown within the Termination Date field. Note : Codes are terminated on an individual basis. In other words, we cannot terminate or “freeze” an entire C-FOP accounting string. If a department would like to have a whole C-FOP terminated, then they need to submit separate requests for each individual fund, organization, and/or program code. How to Submit a Termination Request To submit a termination request, send an email to uas@uillinois.edu with a clear indication of which segment code you would like to terminate. Be sure to include the following in your request: The applicable chart, code number, and title to ensure there is no confusion as to which C-FOAPAL segment code needs terminated. A brief description of why you would like to terminate the code . This is helpful documentation to have in case anyone needs to refer to this reasoning in the future. Also, if you are requesting the termination of a code, keep in mind that certain conditions must be met before the code can be terminated. For example , the code cannot be terminated until all ties to any of the following items are removed from the code: Open encumbrances, active payroll appointments or job positions, active detail codes, active procurement cards (PCards) or travel cards (TCards). If you need assistance determining whether or not any of these items are tied to your code prior to submitting your termination request, feel free to reach out to UAFR for guidance. Note : All general ledger balances must be zeroed out before the fund can be terminated in most cases. However, there are exceptions to this rule (such as self-supporting funds, which can have surplus cash balances lapsed to the income fund during the termination process). Monthly Financial Statements for Terminated Codes Once a code is terminated, you will continue to receive monthly financial statements on the terminated code until the end of the fiscal year, assuming there was financial activity taking place on that code during the fiscal year. However, once the code is terminated, it will not roll into the next fiscal year, and you will no longer receive any type of financial statements on this code in the new fiscal year. Re-Opening a Terminated Code There are a few occasions where a code was terminated, but then needs to be re-opened for a particular reason. For example, a unit may have terminated a gift fund, but then they receive a new donation for that particular gift fund which requires them to re-open the terminated gift fund in order to process the gift and to receive the related gift revenue. While rare, it is allowable to re-open a terminated code in certain scenarios. To do this, there are parameters that must be followed: The code must be used for the same purpose as it was originally established for. The code cannot be re-purposed for new or unrelated activities. If an updated Banner Fund, Program, Index Code Request Form is not on file for the terminated code, UAFR will most likely ask that you complete and submit an updated form prior to re-opening the code. This ensures there is proper documentation on hand which outlines the code’s purpose for future reference. Once re-opened, the code must be regularly monitored, maintained, and reconciled just as it was prior to the termination. If you find yourself in a scenario where you feel you need to re-open a code, reach out to UAFR by sending an email to uas@uillinois.edu , explaining your situation and why you need to have the code re-opened. If approved, UAFR will then assist you in re-opening the code once the proper documentation has been obtained.

This helps ensure accurate reporting for the University of Illinois System’s audited financial statements and helps safeguard system resources. See the information, resources, and tools in the following sections below which can assist you as you develop and carry out your reconciliation processes. Tips for Performing Timely and Effective Reconciliations Given the importance of the financial reconciliation process, it’s important to ensure your reconciliation process is in line with industry standards and good business practices. See below for several points to keep in mind as you develop and carry out your reconciliation processes: Properly Trained Reconcilers Employees who perform financial reconciliations should have an accounting background and should be properly trained. See the Resources section at the end of this webpage for links to various training resources, reconciliation job aids, and standard monthly reports which can assist the reconciler through their reconciliation process. Timely Reconciliations It is essential to perform reconciliations on a timely basis to help ensure that any discrepancies are quickly identified and corrected. To be in compliance with good business practices, we strongly encourage monthly reconciliations. Segregation of Duties To properly safeguard system resources and to help mitigate the risk of fraudulent activity, it is important to ensure a proper segregation of duties in the reconciliation process. This means that the person who performs the reconciliation should not have access to processing the transactions which are being reconciled. This ensures an independent review and reconciliation of the transactions which are being processed. In situations where segregation of duties is not possible (such as in a small department), units should implement mitigating controls, such as a review of financial activity by an independent person at a higher level (such as a department having someone at the college level perform the necessary reconciliations). Tracing Banner Transactions to Source Documents In order to ensure the legitimacy of each Banner transaction, it is beneficial to trace each Banner transaction to the related source document (such as a receipt or deposit form). This helps identify situations where a Banner transaction may differ from the source document, such as when a vendor may have charged an incorrect or duplicate amount. This tracing process helps ensure the accuracy of Banner transactions and helps identify any erroneous transactions which may require further attention. Monitor and Reconcile Balances and Transactions in both the Operating Ledger (OL) and the General Ledger (GL) When performing reconciliations, the typical process is to reconcile OL transactions (such as expenses, revenues, fund transfers, and encumbrances) to the source documents (such as receipts or deposit forms). However, in addition to reconciling OL transactions, it is also important to monitor and reconcile the activity within the GL. This would include monitoring and reconciling transactions and balances in GL account codes such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory for resale, accounts payable, unearned revenue, etc. By reconciling both the OL and the GL, you are helping to ensure the accuracy of your entire set of financial statements (and not just the OL). For example, when reconciling your GL transactions, you may notice that your receivable balance is stagnant and hasn't changed in over a year, or that you have a non-normal balance in one of your liability account codes. Either of these issues would necessitate further investigation to see what the cause of the stagnant or non-normal balance might be, and to address the issue once you identify the cause of the problem. Reconcile Any Shadow Systems to Banner Many units maintain shadow systems to manage their financial activity on a daily basis. While this is allowable, it is essential in these scenarios to ensure that all shadow system activity is reconciled to Banner, which is the University of Illinois System’s official system of record. Any discrepancies between your shadow system and Banner must be addressed and rectified on a timely basis, to ensure that all of your financial activity is properly accounted for within Banner (and not just your shadow system). Since we are audited against Banner (not shadow systems), it is essential that Banner contains all necessary financial information. Resolve Discrepancies Identified During the Reconciliation Process During your reconciliation process, you may identify discrepancies which need addressed (such as duplicate charges from a vendor, misclassified transactions, revenue deposited to an incorrect C-FOAP, expenses recorded to an incorrect account code, etc.) Once these discrepancies are identified, it is important to investigate and correct these discrepancies on a timely basis. By resolving all discrepancies identified during the reconciliation process, you are helping to ensure the overall accuracy of the system’s financial statements. See below for examples: If a transaction was recorded to an incorrect C-FOAP (such as to an incorrect fund code, an incorrect organization code, an incorrect account code, or an incorrect program code), then a Journal Voucher (JV) should be processed to reclassify the transaction to the proper C-FOAP. If a vendor overcharged the system for an expense, then you would need to pursue that discrepancy with the vendor to ensure you are refunded from the overpayment. If a transaction appears in your shadow system (if applicable) and does not appear in Banner, then that transaction would need to be investigated to see if it is legitimate. If so, you would need to ensure that the transaction is properly recorded within Banner on a timely basis.

These reports are updated on a regular basis, so always remember to come back for refreshed reports each time you begin a new reconciliation process. FOAPAL Discrepancy Reports Misclassified C-FOAP Balance Report This report lists C-FOAP balances which contain operating ledger balances that are using an incorrect combination of fund, organization, or program code segments. For example, the three-digit department code embedded in the organization and program code of a state or ICR C-FOP should agree with each other. Items included in this report have been identified as items that could possibly contain misclassified transactions, given that they meet some of the qualifications that we look for when trying to identify misclassified transactions. In addition, this report identifies balances that do not conform to the basic fund type C-FOAP design. For example, a ""generic"" program code (i.e., one that begins with a “19”, such as 191100) should only be used with certain types of funds (such as gift funds). If a state or ICR C-FOP used a generic program code, it would appear on this report, as that is typically not allowable. This report can be used as a tool in identifying misclassified balances and can assist departments in quickly identifying these types of errors. However, it is not designed to identify all misclassified balances. Since this report only lists balances (not individual transactions), you will need to locate the details of the offending transactions by going to Banner page FGIBDST. Once there, enter the unallowable C-FOAP string identified within this report, and then go to the “Related” menu and select “Transaction Detail Information"" [FGITRND]. From here, you will be able to see the individual transactions making up this balance. You will then need to investigate each transaction and complete an reclassification entry to move the transaction to the proper C-FOAP to clear the misclassified error. The Misclassified C-FOAP Report also includes the department names of the fund, organization and program codes used. When correcting a misclassified C-FOAP, please remember to contact the other department involved, if applicable. If you need further assistance, contact the applicable subject matter expert from UAFR by searching on “C-FOAPAL Questions” or “Journal Vouchers” within the Search box of the Business and Finance Who to Ask list. Misclassified C-FOAP Report FOAPAL Maintenance Reports Generic Activity Codes The activity code segment is an optional field. It is used to track financial transactions for particular events or projects with more detail than just the fund, organization, account, and program fields alone. Using an activity code could also reduce the need of establishing new FOP strings to track activities. These generic activity codes are open for use by any department and for any purpose. If you would like to create activity codes specific to your department, see the Banner Activity Code Request Form . Multiple-Person Information (Financial Manager and GLDC) Every fund, organization, and program code has a Financial Manager responsible for this segment and a GLDC used for generating reports in EDDIE. Other information available in these segments include Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator. To view this information in Banner, choose either Fund Code Maintenance FZMFUND , Organization Code Maintenance FZMORGN , or Program Code Maintenance FZMPROG . Select Filter or use F7 to enter query, then enter the chart and segment code and select Go or use F8 (execute query). This will return the segment information. Go to Tools and select Personnel Information . The information may also be reviewed in the attached reports. Keeping this information up to date and accurate is vital for report generation as well as determining who to contact if there are any questions. If this information is incorrect or if additional GLDC's should be added, send an email request to uas@uillinois.edu to have it changed. Be sure to specify the specific piece of information requiring addition or modification. Fund Codes Chart 1 Fund Codes Chart 2 Fund Codes Chart 4 Fund Codes Chart 9 Organization Codes Program Codes Open Encumbrance Reports Accurate encumbrance balances are important because they provide a clear picture of anticipated spending and aid in decision-making. They also inform the campus budget office of the extent of committed state funding. Invalid open encumbrances on June 30th roll into the next fiscal year even though they are no longer needed. These Excel files contain all open general encumbrances, requisitions, and purchase orders. They are organized by chart and three-digit organization code. General encumbrances can be modified or liquidated via journal voucher. See Job Aids & Training Materials Section for instructions on creating these journal vouchers. Requisitions and purchase orders must be modified or closed by the Purchasing Divisions. See Purchasing ""Who to Ask"" Section for contact info. These listings DO NOT contain payroll or indirect cost encumbrances. Any remaining payroll encumbrances will be liquidated before the close of the fiscal year in period 12. The payroll encumbrance amount to be entered for the next fiscal year is based on payroll appointment information. Indirect cost encumbrances are dependent on the total of all other encumbrance balances.

Journal vouchers are typically processed and/or generated by departmental users, Banner modules, or feeder systems. JVs are considered to be “non-cash” transactions since they do not affect the overall cash balance within the University of Illinois System. For example, if a unit processes a JV to reclassify an expense from one C-FOAP to another, there is no movement of cash into or out of the University of Illinois System. While the Claim on Cash balance within the funds involved in the JV may change, the overall cash balance within the U of I System remains unaffected, as it is an accounting entry internal to the U of I System. As outlined within Section 13.3, Journal Vouchers and the Business and Financial Policies and Procedures , units must ensure that all JVs are processed accurately and on a timely basis. This helps ensure accurate reporting for the University of Illinois System’s audited financial statements. Access and Training All new users must complete the Journal Voucher Processing Certificate Track (which is a self-paced, online training program) before they are granted access to process JVs by their Unit Security Contact (USC). This track demonstrates how to prepare, process, and review JVs. It also covers best practices to follow when creating a JV, and where to find resources related to JV transactions. Note : We also strongly encourage those who already have JV-processing access to consider taking this course as a refresher as well, as you may learn something new! There is also an instructor-led training series on Journal Voucher Processing if you would like training in addition to the certificate track. See the information and resources in the following sections below for further guidance. While this is not a complete list of the information that you will need to know when processing or reviewing JVs, it provides a good starting point. Tips for Properly Processing Journal Vouchers In order to ensure accurate, timely JVs that will create a clean audit trail, we strongly encourage you to follow the good business practices listed below when processing JVs: Record JVs in the Correct Fiscal Year and Accounting Period It is important to ensure all JVs are recorded in the fiscal year and accounting period (i.e., month) which properly represents when the transaction occurred. This will help ensure accurate and timely financial reporting. Provide Clear Documentation for JVs It is important to provide clear documentation within the JV to properly communicate the purpose of the entry. By doing this, you help ensure that anyone who reviews your entry (such as an auditor or your supervisor) can get a full picture of the reason the JV was processed. The FOATEXT ( General Text Entry ) page within Banner should be fully completed with the following information for each JV: A detailed description of the accounting transaction being recorded, including any relevant information that may be helpful in creating a proper audit trail for the transaction (such as the original Banner document number of a transaction which the JV may be adjusting or reclassifying). Applicable contact information (i.e., name, e-mail address, unit, and 10-digit phone number). Description Line The Description Line on each sequence of the JV should provide a clear explanation of the transaction. Example #1 : When processing a JV to reclassify an expense from one C-FOAPAL to another, the Description Line on the credit sequence of the JV should include the Banner document number of the expense being reclassified, while the Description Line on the debit sequence should clearly explain the nature of the goods or services that were purchased. Example #2 : When reversing an erroneous JV that was previously completed, it is helpful to include explanatory text such as “To reverse J1234567” in the Description Line so that the reader can easily tell that the purpose of this JV was to reverse a previously completed JV. Process a Separate JV for Each Unique Accounting Transaction It is important to use separate JVs for separate types of entries. That way, each JV accounts for its own unique transaction and is separate from other unrelated transactions which can better aid in the identification of the JV’s purpose. For example, if you identify a misclassified transaction during your monthly reconciliation which needs to be reclassified to the correct C-FOAP, you need to complete the expense reclassification entry on its own unique JV, as opposed to including it with a JV intended for a different purpose (such as a JV to bill your internal customers for services provided). That way, each JV has its own purpose and its own story within the FOATEXT . Correct Journal Voucher Errors To provide a clean audit trail when correcting an erroneous JV that was previously recorded, follow the steps below: First, complete a JV to reverse the erroneous entry from the original transaction. Then, process another JV to post the entry correctly. This will help ensure a clean audit trail in case the JV containing the erroneous transaction is ever selected for further review. Ensure JVs are Only Used to Record Allowable Transactions Unit-generated journal vouchers should not be used to complete certain types of transactions, such as those listed below: Unit-generated JVs should not be used to process budget adjustments for state funds or institutional funds (such as indirect cost recovery, administrative allowance, or royalty). Budget adjustments for these funds should be processed by the applicable university budget office instead. Refer to Section 3.1 (Adjust a Budget) within the Business and Financial Policies and Procedures for further details. Unit-generated JVs should not be used to process labor redistributions that transfer payroll expenses from one C-FOAPAL to another. Refer to the applicable Labor Redistribution Job Aids for further guidance. Unit-generated JVs should not be used to issue any type of payments to custodial funds. These payments should be issued via the appropriate payment method instead (e.g., Emburse Enterprise, purchase orders, etc.). Be Aware of Banner Approval Queues While most JVs post to Banner without a second level of review, some JVs must receive an extra level of review and approval via a Banner Approval Queue prior to posting. The purpose of these approval queues is to have an extra layer of review on higher-risk transactions, so that a third party can review and approve (or disapprove) the entry. This helps add an extra layer of protection to ensure the entry is appropriate. Examples of JVs that must go through a Banner Approval Queue are: Most JVs involving grant funds. Certain types of fund transfers on certain types of funds (such as self-supporting and gift funds). JVs which have a Document Total exceeding $2,000,000. Correct Any JVs That Fail to Pass Cross-FOAPAL Validation Rules The final layer of review and approval which JVs must pass before posting to Banner are the cross-FOAPAL validation rules. These rules have been put into place to help enforce various types of accounting and technical guidelines that all JVs must abide by. If any of your JVs fail to pass these rules, you will be contacted asking to either fix the applicable error or to delete the JV. See below for a few common examples of errors that will cause a JV to fail the cross-FOAPAL validation rules: JVs using an invalid combination of C-FOAPAL segments, such as a JV using a revenue account code on a gift or Indirect Cost Recover (ICR) fund, or a JV trying to use a generic (i.e., “19nnnn”) program code with a state or ICR fund. Trying to use a payroll expense account code (i.e., an account code starting with a 2nnnnn) on a JV. Trying to complete a JV containing multiple debits and credits without using the proper 125 or 175 rule code.

Besides a few exceptions, most labor expenses (account codes beginning with a 2) need to be moved with labor redistributions via Banner form PZAREDS . Permissions Permission to view or redistribute an employee’s gross payroll form PZAREDS in Banner is determined by a person’s access to the employee’s Home Org. If you get an error message in Banner that says there is no data to view for an employee who you know was paid for a given pay event, it is likely that you do not have permission to view that employee's Home Org. Processing In addition to the information below, you can learn about processing labor redistributions with the following job aids: Performing Labor Redistributions Year End Labor Redistributions Timeline of Processing Transactions that make it to disposition 60 prior to 5 p.m. will be moved to disposition 70 and posted to Banner that night unless there is a payroll calculation that night. In the event of a payroll calculation transactions will be updated and posted the following night. Transactions less than disposition 60 need the processor to finish the steps in the above job aid to post. Effective date usage The effective date used in the labor redistribution is when the transaction will be posted to Banner. Extra care needs to be taken at year end to make sure that transactions are posted to the correct FY with the correct posting override date. Comments It is always best practice to leave comments with any labor redistribution like FOATEXT when processing a journal voucher (JV). Basic information such as the reason for the redistribution, your name, phone number, and email address should be included so that future reviewers are able to contact you with questions. Account Code Usage The payroll system is designed to automatically use the correct account code on payroll charges depending on how a position is set up as well as factoring in any potential overrides in the system. Therefore, there are very few circumstances where you should update the account code in a labor redistribution.

As a standard practice, in most cases, fringe benefits are automatically charged and will follow the gross expense for an employee’s payroll. It is inappropriate to move fringe expenses separately from the gross payroll. Types of Fringe Benefits The Payroll System assesses benefits such as: Health, Life, Dental (HLDINS) Medicare OASDI (MEDICARE) Retirement (RETIRMNT) Grad Assistant Health (HDVINS) The Allocation and Assessment System (ALAS) assesses benefits such as: Termination Benefits (TERMBEN) Workers Compensation (WKCOMP) What determines if a fringe expense is assessed to your fund by the payroll system? A fringe expense is assessed to your fund by the payroll system for employees set up by Human Resources (HR) based on if they are resident/non-resident, if their position is benefits eligible, and/or their tax status. To view the assessment status for fund in Banner, use form FTIFATA . Y: Assessed benefits if employee is eligible N: University centrally is assessed fringe if employee is eligible Fringe Benefit Assessments by Fund Type Fringe Corrections Rounding errors can happen on fringe accounts due to labor redistributions between C-FOAPS. For grant fund related fringe rounding issues, please contact your campus office for grants and contracts for help correcting and closing out grant fund balances.

Transactions with terminated C-FOAPAL codes If a transaction is processed and any portion of the transaction is on a terminated FOP segment, Banner substitutes it with the suspense FOP segment so the payroll (or labor redistribution) transaction can be completed. This is most common when processing labor redistributions on prior year state fund related pay events. Posting to a suspense FOP can occur even though no portion of that fund line on the pay event has been changed. Banner first voids all payroll charges on the entire pay event then posts a separate redistribution, even if the FOP has not changed. An original pay event or adjustment posting to a suspense FOP segment should be corrected by processing a labor redistribution using Banner form PZAREDS to correct the FOP segment. For original pay events (sequence 0), this usually occurs when the employee’s labor redistribution is set to a terminated C-FOP and is corrected through Human Resources Front End (HRFE) software. Additionally, the labor redistribution will need to be reversed using Banner form PZAREDS and posted back to the suspense FOP. Checking for balances on the suspense FOP can help determine if a correction is needed. Please contact UAFR if you are unsure if corrective action is needed.

The payroll system uses these dates in processing. For example , if there is an existing record for 1/1/2023 and a JLBD change with an effective date of 7/1/2023, there would be two components for the July monthly pay event (6/16/2023-7/15/2023). The 6/16-6/30 timeframe would pay using the CFOP information on the 1/1/2023 effective dated record, and the 7/1-7/15 timeframe would pay using the 7/1/2023 effective dated information. Impact to Accruals Accruals post for accrual pay events with a JLBD effective date greater than or equal to 7/1 of the new fiscal year. This does not apply to 9/12 employees as that calculation follows different rules. See Payroll Accruals section for how accruals are processed. Impact to Encumbrances If a future effective date is used, encumbrances will only calculate up to that future date. Best Practices to Avoid Known Banner Errors Please review JLBD changes thoroughly before posting them in the system. There is a known issue where not all required voids are posted if multiple changes to the same job are made within one pay period. If you believe your encumbrances are overstated due to this issue, contact uafrpayrollacctg@uillinois.edu for assistance with review and/or correction. The effective date in Banner form PZAREDS dictates the posting date of the redistribution transaction. That posting effective date is separate from the JLBD effective date used in HR Front End. Payroll Accruals Automated process using the existing Banner data to post accruals for pay events that are earned in one Fiscal Year (FY) and paid in the next. Every year MN 7 will be an accrual pay event with accruals posting as MN 999 Depending on the year there will be 1 or 2 BW accrual pay events. If an entire pay event was earned in the prior FY but paid in the next FY, accruals will post as BW 998. If a pay event is earned across two FY but paid in the next FY, accruals will post as BW 999. Accruals will zero out between FY’s (debit to expense in prior FY and credit to expense in following FY) Redistributions cannot be done for accrual transactions after the FY has closed but gross expense can be redistributed. If accrual pay events need to be moved you will look for the standard pay event number to redistribute (MN 7, BW 13, BW 14, BW 15) Training End Date Job Aid Start Date Job Aid Business and Finance For questions or concerns about the BusFin site, please contact sharedservices@uillinois.edu.

This will generally be the earliest of the following: End of the current Fiscal Year (or the Grant end date for multi-year encumbrances) Job end date in NBAJOBS Effective date of a future-dated job distribution record for that employee and job. Encumbrance balances will liquidate each pay period in the amount of the payroll expenses posted that pay period until the balance reaches zero. Timing of When Encumbrances Are Updated in Banner Encumbrances are only updated (recast) in Banner during a main payroll calculation (monthly or biweekly). Because of this, changes to encumbrances may take a few weeks to process in Banner. How to Update Encumbrances Encumbrances reflect the anticipated payroll expenses for a specific job so changes to encumbrances will process based on changing the job distribution record in HR Front End (HRFE) Labor Redistributions in Banner using form PZAREDS will not impact encumbrance balances since the expenses being moved have already been liquidated when the payroll initially posted. How to Close $0 Encumbrances Sometimes an encumbrance is fully liquidated with a $0 balance but has not been closed in the system. If grant related, please contact Grants. For all other funds email uafrpayrollacctg@uillinois.edu . Reviewing Payroll Encumbrances by Person and by Month Payroll Encumbrance reports are located in My UI Financials . Year End Encumbrance Processing For encumbrances that are encumbered on an annual basis, any encumbrance balance at year-end will be fully liquidated. Multi-year encumbrance (MYE) balances roll into the next fiscal year. Annual encumbrances will be recast when the first payroll of the next fiscal year is calculated.

All submitted requests will go through a minimum of three levels of review and approval: department-level , college-level , and university-level . Internal Financial Environment The exception request form requires you to provide information regarding the internal financial environment within your department and/or college. This includes providing detailed information about processes and activities related to three main areas: equipment management, purchasing, and financial reporting. You may draft this information ahead of time in three separate Word documents and attach it to the exception request form. Mitigating Controls and Internal Review Procedures All exception requests must include detailed mitigating controls and internal review procedures to be approved. Mitigating controls are checks and balances to help ensure no fraudulent activities are taking place because of the high-risk system role access resulting from an approved exception request. Your mitigating controls must clearly define how you will monitor the activity of the employee(s) with prohibited role combinations to confirm it follows university policies and procedures and does not expose your department or the university to unnecessary risk. Internal review procedures are the evaluation steps that will be employed within the unit to ensure that your mitigating controls are being followed correctly and consistently. Your review procedures should include how mitigations will be monitored as well as how changes will be identified and acted upon. You may draft this information ahead of time in two separate Word documents and attach it to the exception request form. Approvers and Unit Security Contacts The exception request form will require you to identify the people for at least two levels of approval. You will have to identify the Unit Head (or an authorized delegate) for the department in which the system access will exist. This is the first approval. You will also have to identify someone at the college level, typically a Dean or Dean’s designee, to be the second approver. A third level of approval is required for UIC requests, which will require you to identify the Dean for the college in which the prohibited access will exists. The final approval is at the university level and is routed automatically based on the chart you select on the form. You will also be required to identify the Unit Security Contact (USC) who will be responsible for processing your request in the Security Application after it is approved. The form will provide a link to look up your USC where you can search for your USC using college and department codes. You can also perform that search now with the Find my USC tool. Exception Request Form Exception Request Demonstration Please view this demo session for the new Internal Controls exception request process. The video outlines how to complete the request form and how to process the requests in the Security Application.

The business practices of the unit must promote appropriate use and safeguarding of university resources. Sound practices include a continuous review or internal check of routine transactions. There should be a division of duties, responsibilities, and system access so no person has complete control over all aspects of a financial transaction.

More specifically it: encourages employees to disclose serious breaches of conduct covered by the University policies or state or federal law; informs employees how allegations of wrongful conduct can be disclosed; protects employees from reprisal by adverse employment action as a result of having disclosed wrongful conduct (employees who self-report misconduct are not afforded protection by this policy) or participated in an ethics-related investigation; and provides individuals who believe they have been subject to reprisal a fair process to seek relief from retaliatory acts. Nothing in this policy is intended to interfere with legitimate employment decisions. Policies Regarding Conduct, Behavior, and Reporting The University has developed numerous policies and procedures for enforcing standards of conduct and behavior. Additionally, University employees are expected to abide by applicable state and federal laws. Furthermore, an employee cannot be compelled by a supervisor or University official to violate a University policy, an applicable law, or public policy. In the interest of the University, an employee who has particular knowledge of specific acts which he or she reasonably believes constitute wrongful conduct should disclose the conduct to the University Ethics and Compliance Office via the toll-free Ethics Line at 866-758-2146 or by email at ethicsofficer@uillinois.edu . Employee and Management Responsibility The University's Code of Conduct establishes guidelines for professional conduct and indicates those acting on behalf of the system have a general duty to conduct themselves in a manner that will maintain and strengthen the public's trust and confidence in the integrity of the system and take no actions incompatible with their obligations to the system. System employees are responsible for safeguarding system resources and ensuring they are used only for authorized purposes, in accordance with system rules, policies, and applicable law. It is a violation of University policy for any employee to receive or use University resources for non-University purposes or personal gain. Management employees are responsible for detecting fraudulent activities or misconduct in their areas of responsibility. Each manager should be familiar with the types of improprieties that might occur in his/her area and be alert for any indication that improper or dishonest activity is or was in existence in his/her area. When dishonest or improper activity is detected or suspected, management should determine whether an error or misunderstanding has occurred or whether possible fraud exists. Management is responsible for taking appropriate corrective actions to ensure adequate controls exist to prevent the reoccurrence of fraud. In addition to complying with University policies, employees are expected to comply with all applicable federal and state laws, which include but are not limited to the mandatory reporting of abuse or neglect of minors visiting our univesity or participating in University sponsored activities. Protection for Those Reporting Fraud or Misconduct The State Officials and Employees Ethics Act ( Ethics Act ) , 5 ILCS 430/15-5 et. seq. provides protection to system employees who: Disclose or threaten to disclose to their supervisor or any public body an act or omission that the employee reasonably believes to be a violation of law, rule or regulation by another University employee; Provide information to or testify before any public body conducting an investigation hearing or inquiry into a violation of law, rule, or regulations; or Assist or participate in a proceeding to enforce the Ethics Act . The University will not take retaliatory action such as: Reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee's exercise of any one of the three protected activities, above. The Ethics Act provides remedies for employees if retaliation occurs, and if the employee's work performance or behavior did not warrant the adverse action, which may include one or more of the following: Employee shall be made whole; Reinstatement; Two times back pay; Interest on back pay; and/or Payment of reasonable costs and attorneys' fees. The employee would need to pursue a civil action in order to attempt to receive some or all of the remedial relief listed above. Cooperation Following Report and During an Investigation The reporting employee shall refrain from further involvement in the matter unless directed otherwise by the University Ethics and Compliance Office, the Office of University Audits, University Counsel, or University Police. University employees are required to cooperate with the University Ethics and Compliance Office, Office of University Audits, University Police/Public Safety, the Office of the Executive Inspector General, and other involved law enforcement agencies in the detection, reporting, and investigation of fraud and/or misconduct, including the prosecution of offenders. The University Ethics and Compliance Office, Office of University Audits, University Counsel or University Police/Public Safety will direct management involvement in any University investigation. The University Ethics and Compliance Office maintains records of these allegations. The University Ethics and Compliance Office or a referring unit (for example, internal audit, university police, public safety, human resources) will follow-up on the matter which may include an investigation of the disclosure. Laws and University policies impose privacy and confidentiality restraints on reporting the results of such a review or investigation. Within the constraints of these laws and policies, the University Ethics and Compliance Office will acknowledge, and as appropriate and permissible by law and policy, provide confirmation of the status and outcome of the review. It should be noted that a disclosure warranting an investigation is not the same as making a complaint of reprisal (adverse employment action or situation). In matters of disclosure, the University will make all reasonable efforts to maintain the identity of the employee making the disclosure confidential, as long as maintaining confidentiality does not interfere with conducting an investigation of the specific allegations or taking corrective action. The University will take appropriate disciplinary and legal action against employees who commit fraud. The University's actions may include termination of employment, mandating restitution, and/or informing the appropriate authorities in accordance with University policies and procedures, and state and federal law. Complaints of Reprisal The University Ethics and Compliance Office will coordinate with the President or other senior management official to appoint an investigator. The investigator will report findings and recommendations to the senior management official concerning whether retaliation occurred, and if so, what the appropriate remedy or remedies will be. The decision of the senior management official will be final. Definitions and Examples Employee - Employee is defined as anyone who is compensated by the system or paid a fee for services by the system Management - Management is defined as any administrator, manager, director, supervisor, or other individual who manages or supervises University resources. Resources - Resources are defined as money, property, personnel (including time worked) or any other assets owned or controlled by the system. Retaliatory Action - Retaliatory action includes reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer. Wrongful conduct is defined as : a serious violation of University policy; a serious violation of the University Code of Conduct; a violation of applicable state and federal laws; embezzlement or other financial irregularities; and/or the use of University property, resources, or authority for personal gain or other non-University related purpose except as provided under University policy. Examples of wrongful conduct or fraud covered under this policy include but are not limited to such actions as: Theft, misappropriation, misapplication, destruction, removal, or concealment of University resources including intellectual property; Forgery, falsification, or alteration of documents; Improprieties/misrepresentation in the handling or reporting of money or financial transactions; Authorizing or receiving payment for goods not received or services not performed; Misuse of University facilities, such as telephones, email systems and computers; Intentional violation of the Illinois Procurement Code (30 ILCS 500), including dishonest or improper reporting of results, selective reporting, or omission of conflicting data for deceptive purposes; Accepting or offering bribes, kickbacks, or rebates; Lack of reporting of actual or perceived abuse of a minor; and/or Actions related to concealing or perpetuating above mentioned activities.

The number of victims grows each year, and the cost to individuals and businesses is huge. To combat identity theft at a business level, the Federal Trade Commission enacted the Red Flags Rule (the ""Rule""). The Rule compels companies and organizations that handle personal information and financial accounts (which identity thieves misuse) to establish identity theft prevention programs. The University of Illinois System adopted an Identity Theft Prevention policy and program in 2010. Administration and the U of I System are not exempt from the Rule, because each has a unit that handles personal data and conduct financial activities covered by it. For example, the system bills individuals through Accounts Receivable, and each university has meal plan accounts that thieves could misuse. In addition, many units enter or alter personal identifying information, and ID Centers vet the identity of each person who receives an ID card. These are just a few examples of our operations that relate to funds or data at risk for theft. This site provides the material you need to comply with the policy, as follows: Covered Activities explains what activities require a unit to comply with University of Illinois policy and the Rule. General Requirements lists the conditions that all covered units must meet to comply with Rule. Additional Activity-specific Requirements are listed for Accounts and Cards. Forms is the repository for the unit registration and annual update form, incident form, and exception form.

The U of I System program groups covered activities into four categories: Accounts Cards Goods and Services Personal Information Accounts The Red Flags Rule applies to units that: Administer financial accounts (open, maintain, bill and close) Use consumer credit reports (those issued by Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax) Report information to credit reporting agencies Sell or transfer debts to a third party Covered accounts include: Declining balance and debit accounts (meal plans, Campus Cash or Dragon Dollars, scholarships or aid) Campus-based student loans Loans to students, faculty, or staff Other financial loans Cards Units must comply with the Rule if they: Issue cards that can be used to access accounts Mail cards directly to cardholders Examples of U of I System cards that can access financial accounts Cards can include but are not limited to the following: iCards Visitor identification cards Pay cards Loan cards Other University of Illinois photo IDs Some of the financial accounts U of I System cards can access are: Meal plans Campus debit plans (such as Campus Cash, Dragon Dollars, or Extra Credits) Checking accounts linked to student iCards Bank accounts (for employees issued pay cards) Loan funds (for students issued loan cards) Photocopying services Note: The preceding list is not exhaustive: any other covered accounts that units establish with card-based access are included. Goods and Services The Red Flags Rule Units applies to units that: Provide goods or services that patrons can pay for later. This applies whether you bill and collect through Banner Accounts Receivable, payroll deduction, a third party vendor, or any other system. Require payment at time of sale or service but accept payment over the phone Pursue debt collection (directly or from another unit's services) from nonpaying patrons Bill for fines (which can only be paid for later) Note: Credit card payments don't apply, because the relevant credit card company pays the unit and pursues payment from its individual customers. Personal information The Red Flags program covers units that: Enter new information into any record system Alter data that is already in a system Maintain a system that generates UINs, NetIDs, email addresses, or login names Grant 0% appointments for persons without I-9 forms. Note: Units that enter or alter data only for the purpose of hiring comply with the Red Flags program because they must file an I-9 (Employee Eligibility Verification) form for every new hire. Examples of personally identifying information Personally identifying information for the Red Flags Rule means any data that is or may become associated with covered accounts. It does not matter which system your unit uses to handle personal data; it matters whether that data could be used for covered accounts. The following identifiers can be used alone or in combination with each other to uniquely identify an individual account holder. This list is not exhaustive; your unit may know of other identifiers. Name (first name, middle name, surname or last name, suffix) Address* Phone number* Email address* Birth date Gender University Identification Number (UIN) NetID Login names Social Security number (SSN) *Note: Many U of I System records include several different instances of the same type of identifier. For example, most students and employees have more than one phone number and address on file. Similarly, many systems include a preferred email address in addition to others. Due to name and/or gender changes, multiple names can be associated with one person. Remember: The Rule applies to any identifying information that is or may become associated with a covered account—not just one particular set of identifiers.

Additional activity-specific requirements apply for account- and card-related activities. To determine whether your unit must comply with the Red Flags Rule, see Covered Activities . Existing Policies With other legislation addressing data security for personally identifying information, the Rule assumes that other mandates are being followed so that good data security and privacy measures are already in place. Other mandates include FERPA, HIPAA, and PIPA. The University of Illinois System's data security and privacy policies ensure that these other requirements are being met. The U of I System’s Red Flags program is in addition to the information security policy and other system, university, and unit policies that address identity theft, fraud, and misuse of university ID cards. Links to many of these related policies can be found on AIT IT Policies page. When Establishing or Changing Information in University of Illinois Systems Ensuring the truth of personally identifying information and the person presenting it as his or hers is vital to preventing identity theft. Specific requirements apply for in-person, online, or phone service situations, and these are guided by three overarching requirements When you establish (add) a record in any system, verify identity in person whenever possible. When you change information in any system, verify identity in person or by secure login. Use photo IDs to verify only the personally identifying information that ID contains. Elements not on an ID, such as an address, require other supporting documentation that matches the name on the photo ID. In-Person Services For in-person services the following requirements must be met: ID check University of Illinois ID card or a government-issued photo ID such as a driver's license or passport. See this list of acceptable government IDs . Clear, legible IDs and documents. If a photo is too worn for you to compare with the person, ask for an alternate ID. ID and supporting documents are valid and legitimate, as follows: The ID is not expired, or the document(s) are recent. The photo matches the person in front of you. Any photo, text, or other elements have not been tampered with. There are no other signs of fraud or alteration. If any information is not legible or a document is suspicious, ask for alternate IDs or documents. Note: If your unit provides services to people who have an iCard, visitor card, or other university-issued magnetic-stripe card, it is best to use an electronic card swipe to verify a cardholder's eligibility for service. Card swipes rely on current U of I System records. For Online Services For online services, a password-protected login is required for access and transactions. Logins must comply with the Section 19: Business Systems Access and Security of the Business and Financial Policies and Procedures manual. NetID logins are recommended. Over the Phone Avoid making changes to personally identifying information over the phone. If there is an unavoidable business need to allow phone access, require callers to verify identity by providing nonpublic information about themselves and checking it against office records. Rely only on information that is truly nonpublic. (Date of birth, mother's maiden name, and other information can be found online and are often known to family, friends, and others.) Have Appropriate Procedures, Training, and Supervision in Place The Red Flags Rule mandates an identity theft protection program that is incorporated into daily operations. There is no ""one size fits all"" solution. The University of Illinois System requires that each unit's program must have documented procedures for: Identifying red flags. Detecting and responding to red flags. Keeping current to detect new threats. Units must also: Ensure that staff members are trained to carry out your unit's Red Flags procedures. Provide ongoing supervisory guidance. Identify Red Flags In order to form procedures for detecting and responding to red flags, you must first identify and list the red flags you know and expect your unit will encounter. The Examples of Red Flags are a good starting point, but your unit may know of even more. Be Able to Detect and Respond to Red Flags Document how you will monitor for and detect red flags. Include procedures for how your unit will respond when any red flag is detected. Your procedures must include instructions on how to handle all of the responsibilities related to your unit's covered activities. Keep Your Program Current Make a detailed plan of how your unit will keep current, so it is able to identify and detect new red flags. Ensure that Service Providers Follow the Red Flags Rule If any non-University of Illinois third parties handle account or debt-collection functions for your unit, you must: Inform providers of the U of I System's Red Flags program and policy. Require and maintain a Red Flags compliance statement from each provider. Require providers to report confirmed incidents to you immediately that involve your accounts or the personally identifying information associated with them. Keep a list of these providers and what services (ongoing or new) they provide, used for annual reporting. Establish a Red Flags Unit Contact Person Choose an employee to serve as a unit contact for Red Flags Rule activities. Ideally, this person should be well-informed about your unit's operations relating to covered activities and personal information. Identify your contact person on the Unit Registration and Update form . Unit Contact Responsibilities Unit contacts must participate in Red Flags related training and information sessions as well as report the following relevant information to the Red Flags Steering Committee. What is considered relevant information? Your unit contact must report on: Incidents of confirmed or attempted identity theft. Report these cases immediately using an Incident Report form . Covered activities, third-party service provider arrangements, and new red flags encountered for the calendar year. Provide this information annually, when prompted to by the committee. Possible red flag activities. Email any questions or concerns immediately to rfsc@uillinois.edu . Sale or transfer of debt to any (non-U of I System) third parties.

F&A Costs provide each university with a significant source of institutional funding. The F&A rate is the mechanism used to reimburse the university for the administrative and infrastructure support costs associated with sponsored research and other sponsored projects. It is essentially an overhead rate. There are two broad categories for these expenses, as implied by its name: Facilities Expenses Facilities expenses include various facility costs such as building and equipment depreciation, interest, operations and maintenance including utilities, library, etc. Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses include costs related to various university operations such as general university administration, sponsored projects administration, department administration, and student services administration. Our sponsors recognize the importance of such infrastructure support and reimburse these costs through an accounting mechanism which applies a F&A rate to the modified total direct costs of each project, so that each project (federal and non-federal) pays its fair share of these support costs. F&A Proposal Process Proposals are performed based on a specified fiscal year of actual historical expenditures, space, fixed asset depreciation, and more. The process to calculate, audit, negotiate, and obtain approval for F&A rate proposals is a time intensive process that involves numerous projects and takes approximately two years to complete. Currently, F&A rate proposals are prepared for each of the universities once every four years . To learn more about F&A Rates, refer to Overview of Facilities and Administrative Costs and Rates at University of Illinois . Once F&A rate proposals are compiled: They must to be submitted to Office of Naval Research (ONR). ONR then contracts with the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) to perform an audit of the F&A rate proposal submission(s). ONR then reviews the DCAA audit report and uses it as a negotiation tool to negotiate final F&A rates. Once final negotiated rates and rate periods are determined, ONR issues a formal pre-determined F&A rate negotiation agreement between ONR and the Universities which outlines the maximum rates the universities are permitted to charge sponsored projects during the fiscal years specified. Distribution of F&A Recoveries System Government Costing’s responsibilities do not include distribution of F&A recoveries.

As a result of such waivers, our universities calculate tuition remission rates which are then charged to sponsored project agreements, both federal and non-federal. Tuition remission is considered a direct cost of sponsored projects and is allowable under Uniform Guidance. Currently, our universities follow the accepted method to assess using the average rate basis instead of a flat rate. The rate is assessed as a percentage of the graduate student's salaries (stipend). Currently, only UIUC and UIC assess tuition remission rates. Tuition Remission rates are calculated on an annual basis. If a change in the rate is deemed necessary, the rate change is implemented at the beginning of the fiscal year. Tuition Remission Rate Calculation The tuition remission rate is the result of a calculation based on total graduate tuition waived and related total graduate salaries. The amount of tuition waived by each student is calculated for the two academic year semesters and the summer. Then one average (blended) rate is calculated and assessed.  In the simplest form, the average (blended) rate is the: Total Cost of Tuition Waived for all Graduate Students with Assistantships ÷ Total Salaries of all Graduate Students Receiving Tuition Waivers = Tuition Remission Rate Tuition Remission rates are no longer required to be negotiated between the U of I System and the Office of Naval Research. U of I System Government Costing has compiled formal communications for both UIC and UIUC outlining Allowability of such rates , Overall rate methodology , Tuition remission rates .

The University of Illinois System has a large number of service funds; therefore responsibilities, policies, and requirements have been established which service center funds and service center managers must adhere to. In addition, each service center is required to calculate and charge rates based on actual costs incurred and usage for the services and/or products they provide. These rates are charged against various university funds including sponsored projects. As a result, the calculations of these charges must comply with university, state, and federal costing principles. Service Center and Rate Calculation Policies, Regulations, and Requirements The Code of Federal Regulations (Uniform Guidance Title II CFR Part 200) provides guidelines that establish principles for determining costs applicable to grants, contracts, and other agreements with educational institutions. It also outlines the general federal requirements for calculating service rates. Federal agency Inspector General's audit plans have recently included reviews of service center costs. In addition, for our UIUC and UIC service centers, Section 3.2.0 of the Federal Cost Accounting Standards Disclosure Statement (DS-2) requires the university to provide information related to specialized service facilities and service centers. Following this requirement, we report various information to the federal government related to service centers with $1 million revenue and/or $250,000 in federal sponsored project revenue in our universities’ DS-2s. Service center managers must familiarize themselves with policies, procedures, and regulations they are required to follow when operating service centers. Click on the links listed below to access these regulations, etc. Policies and Procedures - 22 Self-Supporting/Revenue Generating Activities - Service and Storerooms Code of Federal Regulations ( Uniform Guidance Title II CFR Part 200.468 ) The links below provide departments and managers access to departmental center responsibilities, training, rate development principles, Business Objects Webi reports, and Excel templates. System Government Costing Responsibilities It is the service center managers' responsibility to ensure rate calculations are compliant, performed timely, and rates are published. However, on an annual basis the System Government Costing (SGC) identifies select service funds for rate reviews and approvals. There are a wide variety of service funds at the University of Illinois System. Each service center fund is its own business operation and many times contains multiple rates within each fund. In order for our staff to perform these rate reviews/calculations, they must work with each service center to obtain an understanding of their business operations.

Sometimes these products or services are not readily available from external sources, or cannot be obtained conveniently and efficiently. Therefore, the U of I System may need to establish service centers to provide these products and services. When these products or services are provided within the U of I System these units function as non-profit businesses, also called service centers. What is a 3E Service Center? 3E Service Centers are established to: Provide a good/service or groups of goods/services on a recurring basis Provide goods/services primarily to internal customers within the University of Illinois System Recover the costs of providing the good/service through charges or fees to users Add value such as assigned staff and supplies necessary to provide the good/service 3E Service Centers are not established to: Generate a profit Compete with the general public Provide service to the general public as its primary function Build a surplus intended for any purpose or discretionary purpose Service Center Classifications Service centers are classified under a 3E fund type code and differ from other self-supporting activities such as: auxiliaries (3J and 3M fund types) which primarily serve students, faculty, and staff departmental activity accounts (3Q fund type) that are established for services provided primarily to non-system users Many times the 3E service centers service both “internal” and “external” users, although external customers are not the primary function of the service center. Generally, a service center is classified as a 3E fund type if the majority of revenue is generated from internal customers. Internal Users Internal users of service centers are those users whose ultimate source of funds is within the University of Illinois System, or whose funds flow through the U of I System (i.e., sponsored programs). Examples of internal users who purchase services to support their work at the U of I System include academic, research, administrative, and auxiliary areas. External Users External users are organizations or individuals whose ultimate source of funds is outside of the U of I System. External users include the general public and students and any members of faculty or staff acting in a personal capacity. Affiliated hospitals or other universities are considered external users unless the U of I System has subcontracted with them as part of a grant or contract. Although service activities are established principally to serve the internal users, services are occasionally requested by external entities. Service centers should recognize that their primary purpose is to provide services or goods for the system community; therefore, sales to external entities should not be a primary focus and should remain a minimal proportion of total sales. Where the external party is another educational institution, the service may be provided if doing so does not disadvantage University of Illinois System users of the facility. The system rate is charged, increased by the Facilities & Administrative (F&A) rate, also called indirect cost rate, appropriate to the activity. Service Center Examples Examples of Service Centers could include, but are not limited to, the following: machine shops microscopy facilities visualization laboratories carpools chemical analysis labs sediment analysis labs research resource labs animal research labs toxicology research labs, etc. Rate Calc Templates Rate Calculation Template 5 Lines Rate Calculation Template 10 Lines Rate Calculation Template 20 Lines Rate Calculation Template 50 Lines Rate Calculation Template Markup Rate Calculation Template Markup by Direct Labor Rate Calc EDDIE Reports Rate Calculation Financial Report Rate Calculation Financial Report with Depreciation Equipment Depreciation Report Training Service Activity Basics Service Activity Advanced Certification How to Run the Rate Calculation Financial Report in EDDIE How to Populate the Rate Calculation Template How to Perform a Rate Calculation Related Links Rate Review Checklist Facilities & Administrative Rates Service Rate Database Account Code Search Commodity Codes Related Policy 22 Service and Storeroom Activities 16 Sponsored Projects Cost Principles Uniform Guidance Title II CFR Part 200.468 Business and Finance For questions or concerns about the BusFin site, please contact sharedservices@uillinois.edu.

These sponsored programs include federal, state, private, and other governmental programs. Many of these sponsored programs are federally funded and as a result, the U of I System must comply with federal costing principles for service centers. As a major state-supported research university, state regulations related to service activities must also be followed. The University of Illinois System maintains Business and Financial Policies and Procedures applicable to service centers in 22 Self-Supporting/Revenue Generating Activities - Service and Storeroom Activities which incorporate both federal (Title 2 CFR Part 200, also called Uniform Guidance) and state regulations. These policies outline methods service center managers should use when identifying costs, setting rates, and charging users. While these policies apply to storeroom and service center funds tracked in 3E Fund Types – “Service and Storeroom Activities”, they also apply to any service center within any fund type which charges any rate to University of Illinois System sponsored project funds.

Federal costing policies require that stores and services are to operate on a break-even basis. Rates should be designed to recover no more than the aggregate cost of the services. User rates must be supported by cost calculations based on a year of actual historical expenditures and usage (i.e., normally based on fiscal year end data). Estimated rates are generally used only in the first year of operation. Rates cannot be based on generating a specific amount of revenue. Rates cannot include reserves or contingencies. Rates must be established for each individual service or good, unless the usage basis for a group of related services/goods is exactly the same. Rates should be charged based on actual use of the services. The usage basis for the service or good includes all users of the service or good. Rates should not discriminate against federally-supported activities of the institution (i.e. federal users cannot subsidize non-federal users). Federal costing principles allow a working capital reserve of up to 60 days ""cash expenses"" for normal operating purposes. Over- or under recovery of the service activity adjusted fund balance must be incorporated into the rate calculation. Each unit is responsible for the management of its stores and service activities, including the establishment and documentation for each service rate. Frequency of Rate Reviews and Calculations Formal rate calculations must be performed at least once every two years and rates adjusted accordingly. Best practices indicate rates should be reviewed annually by the department. In addition, between typical rate calculation time frames, if there is a significant change in user base or costs to provide the services, the department should re-calculate rates and implement new rates as soon as possible. This should be done to ensure users are being billed fairly for the services/goods they are receiving and to ensure the service center is not incurring an unexpected large surplus or deficit. Charging Established Rates to All Users Service center managers must ensure that there is no cross-subsidization between user groups. Combining the results of various services is not acceptable if the mix of users of each service is different; that is, if higher prices charged to one set of users are subsidizing the lower rates charged to a different group of users. Rates should not discriminate against federally-supported activities of the institution (i.e., federal users cannot subsidize non-federal users). All users must be billed. All internal users must be charged at the same rate for the same level of service or product purchased. User rates consisting of flat fees are not appropriate and do not comply with costing principles (i.e., flat monthly fee). Users may not be billed until services have been rendered or goods received. In other words, prepayment of services/goods by a customer is not allowed. When preferential rates or free services are provided to some users (students and departments) rate calculations must be based on billing at the full cost. In this instance, the customer is charged a portion of the rate and the remainder must be charged to departmental unrestricted funds. Also, the portion of the rate funded by other university funds need to be separately identifiable in Banner. A best practice is to utilize a separate program code with an A-21 attribute code of ""SNS"" (Stores and Services) assigned by System Government Costing in coordination with University Accounting & Financial Reporting. This is necessary to allow for proper treatment in the F&A Rate Calculation. External users may be charged a higher billing rate than internal users to recover F&A costs or other related expenses. At a minimum, service activities must charge external customers the fully-costed rate plus the applicable Facilities and Administrative (F&A) rate. The fully-costed rate is the internal rate, plus additional costs that support the service but are unallowable for internal rates. Key Elements of Proper Accounting Only services/goods that are “like and similar” should be combined in a service fund. This aids with the proper calculation of rates and the allocation of over/under recoveries by line of service. Accurate accounting for service center expenses and revenues is critical for tracking of accurate over/under recoveries and proper rate calculations. The following accounting practices assist in ensuring this is accomplished. Expenditures to Revenue Match Service centers should “match” revenue with expenditures so that a true financial picture can be obtained for the fund. Identify Expenditures and Revenue by Line of Services When multiple lines of similar services are maintained in one service fund, the department must be able to identify expenditures and revenue by line of service. This is necessary for accurate tracking of net income, over/under recoveries, and compliant rate calculations. A best practice is to utilize separate “activity” or “program” codes. Billing Billings should be issued to users as soon as the service is rendered or the goods delivered. Any self-supporting activity that provides goods or services to a sponsored project must bill the related project fund monthly. When providing goods or services to non-sponsored project customers, quarterly billing is required. However, it is best practice to issue billings on a monthly basis. Journal Voucher and Sales Invoice Requirements The journal voucher or sales invoice is to indicate the service provided, date of service or sale (date range if applicable), unit cost (i.e., the rate and number of units sold), and total dollars charged to the user. A best practice is to utilize the FOATEXT for detail regarding the service or good provided. Record Revenue Properly as a Credit in Revenue Account Code Revenue should be properly recorded as a credit in a revenue account code, not incorrectly booked under an expense account code. The practice of recording revenue as a negative expense distorts the financial statements and results in unnecessary analysis of the service account/funds to identify these entries and eliminate them from the rate calculation. Use the detailed revenue account code that most closely aligns with the service provided by the service activity. External revenue must be recorded in account code 307921 The difference in the rate charged to the internal customers and external customers represents the increment of revenue to be recorded in 307921. Track Base Usage The department must track usage (base) including at a minimum, the date of the sale or service, unit cost, and total dollars charged to the user. Service activities must use a measurable unit which allocates costs equitably among all customers based on their usage. The usage base selected must represent the cost/benefit each customer receives. Rate Calculations and Supporting Documents on File Rate calculations and supporting documentation (including detailed base support) must be maintained on-file by the department and made available for review upon request by system administrators, as well as system, state, and federal auditors. Published Rates Readily Available The department must have published rates readily available upon request. This can be accomplished by publishing rates on-line, posting a rate sheet, or maintaining a hard copy rate sheet on-site. Auditors expect rates to be readily available and often request rate sheets during audits.

In addition, the internal rate must exclude the following: Salaries and wages not recorded in the service fund Unallowable costs Federal equipment depreciation Fringe benefits F&A rate appropriate to the activity Not only is the U of I System a non-profit institution, policies, and regulations require the service center to break-even over a period of time. It is not appropriate to generate profit from internal users. External Users The rate to be charged to external users is the higher of either the rate that approximates the comparable commercial rate (market rate) or the fully costed rate, which is the internal system rate increased by the following: All salaries, wages, and non-personnel expenditures related to providing the service or good Unallowable costs Federal equipment depreciation Fringe Benefits F&A rate appropriate to the activity External rates which exclude F&A indirect cost rates results in U of I System sponsored projects (including federal sponsors) subsidizing external users because F&A is later assessed on service rates charged to sponsored projects. Over/Under Recovery Identification Process Costing policies require that stores and services operate on a break-even basis. Over-or-under recovery of the service activity adjusted fund balance must be incorporated into the rate calculation. This is accomplished as part of a three-step process as outlined in the next three topics: Adjusted Fund Balance Working Capital Reserve Over/Under Recovery Step 1 - Adjusted Fund Balance Service centers must calculate and monitor their Adjusted Fund Balances. The Banner fixed assets system does not directly interface with the general ledger and operating ledger. In addition, depreciation is only calculated and booked in the general ledger at a highly summarized level during the year end close process. Therefore, the Adjusted Fund Balance must be calculated and used in calculating and monitoring fund balances and over/under recoveries. For assets purchased on the service center fund , the net asset value of the asset must be calculated and included in the service center fund balance. Since the net asset value is normally a debit balance, the fund balance will be credited or increased to arrive at an adjusted fund balance. For assets used in the service center and purchased with other funds (ICR or Gift), the accumulated depreciation may be removed from the fund balance. The fund balance will be debited or decreased to arrive at an adjusted fund balance. However, please contact System Government Costing for assistance with the adjusted fund balance calculation. The fund balance will be adjusted to include the NAV of the 3E equipment and adjusted to remove the non-3E accumulated depreciation along with any adjustments for unallowable or unrelated expenditures. The adjustments will have the following impact when calculating the Adjusted Fund Balance. The end of year fund balance should be adjusted to: Include the NAV of the equipment, causing a surplus amount to increase or a deficit amount to decrease. Remove the non-3E accumulated depreciation, causing a surplus amount to decrease or a deficit amount to increase. Remove any expenditures that were unallowable for the internal rate (i.e. bad debt and credit card fees). Account for certain unallowable or unrelated expenditures. This adjustment is necessary for any expenditures that were transferred off the fund unless the transfers were completed in the same fiscal year as the original expense. If you have questions, please contact System Government Costing for assistance. Step 2 - Working Capital Reserve Costing policies allow service centers to maintain a working capital reserve of up to 60 calendar days cash expenses for normal operating purposes. Balances in excess of this amount should be eliminated over a period of time, normally 2 years. Once the limitation is calculated it is compared to the service center’s adjusted fund balance to calculate and monitor over recoveries. Note that the limitation applies to over recoveries only. Identify cash expenditures for the year (excludes depreciation and capital asset purchases). Calculate 60 Day Working Capital Reserve by taking the last 12 months of cash expenditures for normal operations divided by 6 months. Step 3 - Over/Under Recovery Service centers that accumulate an adjusted fund balance surplus in excess of working capital reserve limitation must adjust future rate calculations in order to meet costing policy break-even requirements. It is important to note that the over or under recovery balance identified and included in the rate calculation must be the accumulated balance incurred whether over one year or multiple years. System policies including federal regulations indicate a service center must take into consideration over/under applied costs of the previous period(s). The adjusted fund balance must be compared to the 60-day working capital reserve limitation to calculate the amount of over recovery to be included in a rate calculation. To calculate the service center’s Over/Under Recovery, you must perform the process outlined below: Identify the Adjusted Fund Balance. Identify the Working Capital Reserve. Calculate the Over/Under Recovery by comparing the adjusted fund balance to the working capital reserve. If the adjusted fund balance is a surplus but more than the working capital reserve, the fund has an over-recovery. The difference represents the amount to include in next year’s rate calculation. If the adjusted fund balance is a surplus but less than the working capital reserve, the fund has neither an over nor under-recovery. The difference represents the amount to include in next year’s rate calculation. If the adjusted fund balance is a deficit, the fund has an under-recovery. The difference represents the amount to include in next year’s rate calculation.

Service center expenses must be clearly identifiable and be under the control of the center’s staff. In addition, expenses must be directly identifiable for each service line or product where possible, or easily allocated based on a reasonable, justifiable, and documentable method. Expenses cannot be aggregated across a group of services or products and cannot be allocated based on revenue. Typical normal operating expenses are: Salaries and wages (base salary) of individuals providing the service, producing the goods, or those administering the service center (including raises if anticipated for the upcoming year and vacant positions to be filled in the immediate future) Materials and supplies Maintenance and repair of equipment assigned to the service activity Full cost of “non-capitalized” equipment in year incurred Annual depreciation expense of “capitalized” equipment Service contracts (e.g. maintenance agreement) Professional services Special conferences or training including related travel, etc., must be specifically related to the operation of the service center Inventory-related costs where applicable (cost of goods sold) Over- or under-recovery of the service activity adjusted fund balance Unallowable Expenses There are costs which may be allowable for the University of Illinois System to incur, but are considered unallowable to include in the service fund and rate calculations. The U of I System maintains policy Section 16: Grants and Research Contracts – Sponsored Projects Cost Principles (incorporates Federal and State regulations), which indicates selected items of costs and whether they are allowable or unallowable. Units are prohibited from charging the following costs to their self-supporting funds: Expenses which do not benefit the service activity Expenses unallowable under U of I System policy, federal regulations, or state regulations Indirect expenses included in the Facilities & Administrative Rate Calculation , such as the state paid salaries of administrative staff (e.g., department business office) and Operations and Maintenance Division expenses paid by the system, may not be recovered as a component of the service fee or markup rate charged to internal users because these costs are recovered as a component of the system's F&A rate. Including such expenses in both service rates and F&A would result in double charging. Examples of unallowable costs are: Advertising expenses, except for employee and subject recruitment Alcoholic beverages Entertainment costs Fines and penalties Goods and services for personal use Interest Membership in any civic or community organization, country club, or social or dining club Public relations costs Selling and marketing costs Some unallowable expenditures can remain on the fund but must be excluded from the internal rates. Any expenditures that are unallowable for internal rates but are allowed to remain on the fund, should be included in the external rates. Some examples are: Bad debts Credit card fees Depreciation Expenses Policy and regulations state that only the annual depreciation expense of capitalized assets can be included in service rate calculations, not the full cost of the equipment in the year purchased. In addition, the following guidelines apply: The cost of capitalized assets must be depreciated over the asset’s useful life based on the assigned commodity code. Visit the Equipment Management Glossary page for a definition of commodity codes. The depreciation expense included in the rate calculation must be consistent with depreciation used in the U of I System's financial statements. The system uses the straight-line depreciation method with the half-year convention in the year of purchase and final year For a department to include depreciation expense in a rate calculation, an entity code must be assigned to the equipment in the Banner Fixed Asset system. Failure to assign this code may result in improperly including the depreciation expense in the system's F&A Rate calculations. Each unit is responsible for contacting the University Property Accounting and Reporting office when entity codes need assigned or updated in the Fixed Asset system. Depreciation related to assets purchased on “federal” sponsored projects is applicable as follows: Internal rates - Can never be included External rates - Can be included in external rates once the sponsored project period has ended. As value is still being derived from the item even though it has no remaining book value. Depreciation related to assets purchased on “non-federal” sponsored projects is applicable as follows: Internal rates - Can be included once the sponsored project period has ended. There must be remaining depreciation available for inclusion in service rates. External rates - Can be included once the sponsored project period has ended. Value is still being derived from the item even though it has no remaining book value.

All users or usage base (internal and external) must be included in the base whether charged or not. This is in accordance with University of Illinois System policy and federal guidance, which states that costs of services must be charged based on actual usage of the services and does not discriminate between activities (e.g. sponsored project or other users). Service center managers must ensure there is no cross-subsidization between user groups. Combining the results of various services is not acceptable when the mix of users of each service is different. The center must use the measurement which considers the cost/benefit of the product or service being provided, in other words, use the measurement which allocates costs equitably among all customers or usage base. This is in accordance with University of Illinois System policy and federal guidance which states when charging costs to a cost objective (e.g. sponsored project or departmental funds) costs must be charged based on the “relative benefits received”. In other words, service rates must be charged based on actual usage. Detailed supporting base documentation must be maintained on-file by the department and made available for review upon request by system administrators, as well as U of I System, state, and federal auditors. A service center may have different measurable units/bases for the different types and classes of products or services it offers. For example, a center that performs tests on samples has a couple of possible units of measure; it could charge per test or per hour. If certain tests take twice as long as others, and labor is a large portion of the cost of performing a test, it is not equitable to charge each user on a per test basis. In such circumstances, the user rate should be charged on a per hour basis. In addition, the service center needs to consider the types of rates they need to implement when determining proper base for rate calculations (e.g. training rate, staff assist hourly rate, sample rate, etc.). When determining usage base, the service activity must identify usage not billable to customers and confirm that these units are not included in the base total. For example, if the service provides equipment testing per sample, then samples consumed in quality control testing would not be billable to a specific customer and therefore should not be included in the base total. Below are examples of non-billable units for different types of base units and an example of a base calculation: Examples of Non-Billable Units Hourly Equipment Sample Testing Square Footage Vacation, sick, and holiday hours Testing hours, such as quality control Quality control Common area space Indirect hours Maintenance / Repair / Downtime hours Failed samples Unoccupied Space Note: Excluding non-billable units (such as vacation time, or quality control samples) does not necessarily mean the associated costs are unallowable on the fund (allowable costs still flow into the numerator of the rate). This step simply excludes those units from the denominator of the rate calculation.

To classify a general ledger transaction to the proper asset (5nnnn) or liability (6nnnn) account code within Banner for financial reporting purposes. To classify expense transactions to the proper Statewide Accounting Management System (SAMS) code per state reporting requirements. To ensure accuracy and clarity in a unit’s financial statements which allows unit management to clearly see the types of expenses that were incurred, the type of revenue that was earned, the types of fund transfers that were processed, and the types of assets and liabilities that are on the books. This type of detailed information can ensure unit management has accurate information on hand which can aid them when making budgeting and financial planning decisions, as well as when reconciling and reviewing past data. Given the impact that account codes have on the University of Illinois System’s financial reporting processes, it is very important to ensure that accurate account codes are assigned to your various Banner transactions. Account Code Search The Account Code Search application allows you to identify the proper account code to use on your various transactions. This application provides the full details behind each account code, such as: The full account code title, along with the shortened Banner title The account code description, which provides the definition Examples of common uses of the account code Details regarding scenarios when the account code should not be used Tips on Using the Application Use the Lookup section of the Code Search tab to search for a specific account code. If you do not know the specific account code, use the keyword search within the Code Search tab. These searches can be performed using a single keyword or even a phrase, similar to how a search would be completed on an internet browser.

This accounting system commonly used by non-profit and governmental organizations emphasizes accountability (not profitability) to ensure proper stewardship of financial resources as well as compliance with applicable regulations, guidelines, and restrictions associated with the various funding sources that the University of Illinois System receives. For more details, see Section 13.1, Overview of University Fund Accounting within the Business and Financial Policies and Procedures . To help maintain a financial reporting structure that can be consistently used across the U of I System to ensure accurate financial reporting and compliance with fund accounting principles, a chart of accounts, or an “accounting string”, was developed for all system units report their financial activity. C-FOAPAL Accounting String Segment Codes The accounting string used at the U of I System is called a C-FOAPAL string. See the information below for further details on what each segment of the C-FOAPAL accounting string represents. C = Chart The chart code is a one-digit code for the applicable university or System Office that the accounting string belongs to. There are four chart codes – see below for an explanation of what each code represents: Chart 1 = University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Chart 2 = University of Illinois Chicago Chart 4 = University of Illinois Springfield Chart 9 = University of Illinois System Offices F = Fund The fund code is a six-digit code which identifies the funding source of the financial resources for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Financial resources received by the U of I System need to be recorded in separate fund types to denote the funding source, with each fund type having a different purpose depending on the revenue. For example, financial resources received from state appropriations would be credited to a state fund, while financial resources received from donors would be credited to a gift fund. O = Organization The organization code (also commonly referred to as an “org” code) is a six-digit code that represents which unit owns and is fiscally responsible for that specific accounting string. The first three digits of the organization code typically designates the college, department, or unit that owns the organization code, while the subsequent three digits further classify the code’s ownership (such as to a particular department within a college, etc.) A = Account The account code is either a five-digit code (for the general ledger) or a six-digit code (for the operating ledger) that designates a transaction as an expense, revenue, transfer, asset, or liability. Proper account code usage is crucial for accurate financial reporting and state reporting requirements. For further details on this important segment of the C-FOAPAL accounting string, refer to UAFR’s dedicated Banner Account Codes webpage. P = Program The program code is a six-digit code that has a variety of important financial reporting implications, including the classification of expense transactions to the proper “function” (or purpose) according to standard definitions developed by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO). This code also helps distinguish between a unit’s operational activities within fund types that may record multiple activities in a single fund (e.g., state, institutional, self-supporting, service plan, and federal agricultural research funds). For further details on this important segment of the C-FOAPAL accounting string, refer to UAFR’s dedicated Overview of Banner Program Codes & NACUBO Functions webpage. A = Activity (Optional) The activity code is an optional three-digit or six-digit code that may be used to track specific financial activities or projects. For example, if Professor A has three different projects taking place within a particular C-FOAP accounting string, then that professor may want to assign separate activity codes to each of the three separate activities in order to segregate out the financial transactions for each project. A list of Generic Activity Codes are open for use by any department and for any purpose. However, if you would like to request a new activity code specifically for your department to use, then you may request a new unique code as well. Finally, keep in mind that Banner does not require activity codes on financial transactions. Be aware if you do use activity codes, there is always a risk of financial transactions posting without the activity code assigned. For example, if the user forgot to include the activity code on a journal voucher transaction. L = Location (Optional) The location code is an optional six-digit code that is primarily used (but not limited to) the Fixed Asset module. This code designates the physical location, such as a building and room number of an asset (such as a piece of furniture owned by the U of I System). Other Codes See below for an explanation of other helpful codes. While these codes are not necessarily a part of the standard C-FOAPAL accounting string, it is helpful to know what they represent. Index Code (Optional) The index code is an optional six-digit code that may be used to conserve keystrokes when typing out the full C-FOAPAL accounting string (such as within a journal voucher). For example, if a unit frequently completes journal vouchers which use the same chart, fund, organization, and program code, then the user may want to establish an index code that will quickly fill in those C-FOP segments when they are completing their journal voucher. Instead of having to manually type in each one of these segment codes, they can request the establishment of a six-digit index code to use instead. Once UAFR establishes the index code at the unit’s request, the user can enter that six-digit index code into the applicable field of the journal voucher page, and the applicable chart, fund, organization, and program code will automatically default into the journal voucher page. This saves the user quite a few keystrokes, and helps eliminate the possibility of a typing error. Also, all index codes which are tied to either a state or federal work study fund will be updated automatically on July 1 each year to reflect the new fiscal year’s fund code. So, there would be no need for the unit to request a new index code in those scenarios. Who to Ask For further details, contact the applicable subject matter experts listed in the Who to Ask list.

This helps ensure accurate reporting for the University of Illinois System’s audited financial statements and helps safeguard system resources. See the information, resources, and tools in the following sections below which can assist you as you develop and carry out your reconciliation processes. Tips for Performing Timely and Effective Reconciliations Given the importance of the financial reconciliation process, it’s important to ensure your reconciliation process is in line with industry standards and good business practices. See below for several points to keep in mind as you develop and carry out your reconciliation processes: Properly Trained Reconcilers Employees who perform financial reconciliations should have an accounting background and should be properly trained. See the Resources section at the end of this webpage for links to various training resources, reconciliation job aids, and standard monthly reports which can assist the reconciler through their reconciliation process. Timely Reconciliations It is essential to perform reconciliations on a timely basis to help ensure that any discrepancies are quickly identified and corrected. To be in compliance with good business practices, we strongly encourage monthly reconciliations. Segregation of Duties To properly safeguard system resources and to help mitigate the risk of fraudulent activity, it is important to ensure a proper segregation of duties in the reconciliation process. This means that the person who performs the reconciliation should not have access to processing the transactions which are being reconciled. This ensures an independent review and reconciliation of the transactions which are being processed. In situations where segregation of duties is not possible (such as in a small department), units should implement mitigating controls, such as a review of financial activity by an independent person at a higher level (such as a department having someone at the college level perform the necessary reconciliations). Tracing Banner Transactions to Source Documents In order to ensure the legitimacy of each Banner transaction, it is beneficial to trace each Banner transaction to the related source document (such as a receipt or deposit form). This helps identify situations where a Banner transaction may differ from the source document, such as when a vendor may have charged an incorrect or duplicate amount. This tracing process helps ensure the accuracy of Banner transactions and helps identify any erroneous transactions which may require further attention. Monitor and Reconcile Balances and Transactions in both the Operating Ledger (OL) and the General Ledger (GL) When performing reconciliations, the typical process is to reconcile OL transactions (such as expenses, revenues, fund transfers, and encumbrances) to the source documents (such as receipts or deposit forms). However, in addition to reconciling OL transactions, it is also important to monitor and reconcile the activity within the GL. This would include monitoring and reconciling transactions and balances in GL account codes such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory for resale, accounts payable, unearned revenue, etc. By reconciling both the OL and the GL, you are helping to ensure the accuracy of your entire set of financial statements (and not just the OL). For example, when reconciling your GL transactions, you may notice that your receivable balance is stagnant and hasn't changed in over a year, or that you have a non-normal balance in one of your liability account codes. Either of these issues would necessitate further investigation to see what the cause of the stagnant or non-normal balance might be, and to address the issue once you identify the cause of the problem. Reconcile Any Shadow Systems to Banner Many units maintain shadow systems to manage their financial activity on a daily basis. While this is allowable, it is essential in these scenarios to ensure that all shadow system activity is reconciled to Banner, which is the University of Illinois System’s official system of record. Any discrepancies between your shadow system and Banner must be addressed and rectified on a timely basis, to ensure that all of your financial activity is properly accounted for within Banner (and not just your shadow system). Since we are audited against Banner (not shadow systems), it is essential that Banner contains all necessary financial information. Resolve Discrepancies Identified During the Reconciliation Process During your reconciliation process, you may identify discrepancies which need addressed (such as duplicate charges from a vendor, misclassified transactions, revenue deposited to an incorrect C-FOAP, expenses recorded to an incorrect account code, etc.) Once these discrepancies are identified, it is important to investigate and correct these discrepancies on a timely basis. By resolving all discrepancies identified during the reconciliation process, you are helping to ensure the overall accuracy of the system’s financial statements. See below for examples: If a transaction was recorded to an incorrect C-FOAP (such as to an incorrect fund code, an incorrect organization code, an incorrect account code, or an incorrect program code), then a Journal Voucher (JV) should be processed to reclassify the transaction to the proper C-FOAP. If a vendor overcharged the system for an expense, then you would need to pursue that discrepancy with the vendor to ensure you are refunded from the overpayment. If a transaction appears in your shadow system (if applicable) and does not appear in Banner, then that transaction would need to be investigated to see if it is legitimate. If so, you would need to ensure that the transaction is properly recorded within Banner on a timely basis.

Journal vouchers are typically processed and/or generated by departmental users, Banner modules, or feeder systems. JVs are considered to be “non-cash” transactions since they do not affect the overall cash balance within the University of Illinois System. For example, if a unit processes a JV to reclassify an expense from one C-FOAP to another, there is no movement of cash into or out of the University of Illinois System. While the Claim on Cash balance within the funds involved in the JV may change, the overall cash balance within the U of I System remains unaffected, as it is an accounting entry internal to the U of I System. As outlined within Section 13.3, Journal Vouchers and the Business and Financial Policies and Procedures , units must ensure that all JVs are processed accurately and on a timely basis. This helps ensure accurate reporting for the University of Illinois System’s audited financial statements. Access and Training All new users must complete the Journal Voucher Processing Certificate Track (which is a self-paced, online training program) before they are granted access to process JVs by their Unit Security Contact (USC). This track demonstrates how to prepare, process, and review JVs. It also covers best practices to follow when creating a JV, and where to find resources related to JV transactions. Note : We also strongly encourage those who already have JV-processing access to consider taking this course as a refresher as well, as you may learn something new! There is also an instructor-led training series on Journal Voucher Processing if you would like training in addition to the certificate track. See the information and resources in the following sections below for further guidance. While this is not a complete list of the information that you will need to know when processing or reviewing JVs, it provides a good starting point. Tips for Properly Processing Journal Vouchers In order to ensure accurate, timely JVs that will create a clean audit trail, we strongly encourage you to follow the good business practices listed below when processing JVs: Record JVs in the Correct Fiscal Year and Accounting Period It is important to ensure all JVs are recorded in the fiscal year and accounting period (i.e., month) which properly represents when the transaction occurred. This will help ensure accurate and timely financial reporting. Provide Clear Documentation for JVs It is important to provide clear documentation within the JV to properly communicate the purpose of the entry. By doing this, you help ensure that anyone who reviews your entry (such as an auditor or your supervisor) can get a full picture of the reason the JV was processed. The FOATEXT ( General Text Entry ) page within Banner should be fully completed with the following information for each JV: A detailed description of the accounting transaction being recorded, including any relevant information that may be helpful in creating a proper audit trail for the transaction (such as the original Banner document number of a transaction which the JV may be adjusting or reclassifying). Applicable contact information (i.e., name, e-mail address, unit, and 10-digit phone number). Description Line The Description Line on each sequence of the JV should provide a clear explanation of the transaction. Example #1 : When processing a JV to reclassify an expense from one C-FOAPAL to another, the Description Line on the credit sequence of the JV should include the Banner document number of the expense being reclassified, while the Description Line on the debit sequence should clearly explain the nature of the goods or services that were purchased. Example #2 : When reversing an erroneous JV that was previously completed, it is helpful to include explanatory text such as “To reverse J1234567” in the Description Line so that the reader can easily tell that the purpose of this JV was to reverse a previously completed JV. Process a Separate JV for Each Unique Accounting Transaction It is important to use separate JVs for separate types of entries. That way, each JV accounts for its own unique transaction and is separate from other unrelated transactions which can better aid in the identification of the JV’s purpose. For example, if you identify a misclassified transaction during your monthly reconciliation which needs to be reclassified to the correct C-FOAP, you need to complete the expense reclassification entry on its own unique JV, as opposed to including it with a JV intended for a different purpose (such as a JV to bill your internal customers for services provided). That way, each JV has its own purpose and its own story within the FOATEXT . Correct Journal Voucher Errors To provide a clean audit trail when correcting an erroneous JV that was previously recorded, follow the steps below: First, complete a JV to reverse the erroneous entry from the original transaction. Then, process another JV to post the entry correctly. This will help ensure a clean audit trail in case the JV containing the erroneous transaction is ever selected for further review. Ensure JVs are Only Used to Record Allowable Transactions Unit-generated journal vouchers should not be used to complete certain types of transactions, such as those listed below: Unit-generated JVs should not be used to process budget adjustments for state funds or institutional funds (such as indirect cost recovery, administrative allowance, or royalty). Budget adjustments for these funds should be processed by the applicable university budget office instead. Refer to Section 3.1 (Adjust a Budget) within the Business and Financial Policies and Procedures for further details. Unit-generated JVs should not be used to process labor redistributions that transfer payroll expenses from one C-FOAPAL to another. Refer to the applicable Labor Redistribution Job Aids for further guidance. Unit-generated JVs should not be used to issue any type of payments to custodial funds. These payments should be issued via the appropriate payment method instead (e.g., Emburse Enterprise, purchase orders, etc.). Be Aware of Banner Approval Queues While most JVs post to Banner without a second level of review, some JVs must receive an extra level of review and approval via a Banner Approval Queue prior to posting. The purpose of these approval queues is to have an extra layer of review on higher-risk transactions, so that a third party can review and approve (or disapprove) the entry. This helps add an extra layer of protection to ensure the entry is appropriate. Examples of JVs that must go through a Banner Approval Queue are: Most JVs involving grant funds. Certain types of fund transfers on certain types of funds (such as self-supporting and gift funds). JVs which have a Document Total exceeding $2,000,000. Correct Any JVs That Fail to Pass Cross-FOAPAL Validation Rules The final layer of review and approval which JVs must pass before posting to Banner are the cross-FOAPAL validation rules. These rules have been put into place to help enforce various types of accounting and technical guidelines that all JVs must abide by. If any of your JVs fail to pass these rules, you will be contacted asking to either fix the applicable error or to delete the JV. See below for a few common examples of errors that will cause a JV to fail the cross-FOAPAL validation rules: JVs using an invalid combination of C-FOAPAL segments, such as a JV using a revenue account code on a gift or Indirect Cost Recover (ICR) fund, or a JV trying to use a generic (i.e., “19nnnn”) program code with a state or ICR fund. Trying to use a payroll expense account code (i.e., an account code starting with a 2nnnnn) on a JV. Trying to complete a JV containing multiple debits and credits without using the proper 125 or 175 rule code.

Besides a few exceptions, most labor expenses (account codes beginning with a 2) need to be moved with labor redistributions via Banner form PZAREDS . Permissions Permission to view or redistribute an employee’s gross payroll form PZAREDS in Banner is determined by a person’s access to the employee’s Home Org. If you get an error message in Banner that says there is no data to view for an employee who you know was paid for a given pay event, it is likely that you do not have permission to view that employee's Home Org. Processing In addition to the information below, you can learn about processing labor redistributions with the following job aids: Performing Labor Redistributions Year End Labor Redistributions Timeline of Processing Transactions that make it to disposition 60 prior to 5 p.m. will be moved to disposition 70 and posted to Banner that night unless there is a payroll calculation that night. In the event of a payroll calculation transactions will be updated and posted the following night. Transactions less than disposition 60 need the processor to finish the steps in the above job aid to post. Effective date usage The effective date used in the labor redistribution is when the transaction will be posted to Banner. Extra care needs to be taken at year end to make sure that transactions are posted to the correct FY with the correct posting override date. Comments It is always best practice to leave comments with any labor redistribution like FOATEXT when processing a journal voucher (JV). Basic information such as the reason for the redistribution, your name, phone number, and email address should be included so that future reviewers are able to contact you with questions. Account Code Usage The payroll system is designed to automatically use the correct account code on payroll charges depending on how a position is set up as well as factoring in any potential overrides in the system. Therefore, there are very few circumstances where you should update the account code in a labor redistribution.

Transactions with terminated C-FOAPAL codes If a transaction is processed and any portion of the transaction is on a terminated FOP segment, Banner substitutes it with the suspense FOP segment so the payroll (or labor redistribution) transaction can be completed. This is most common when processing labor redistributions on prior year state fund related pay events. Posting to a suspense FOP can occur even though no portion of that fund line on the pay event has been changed. Banner first voids all payroll charges on the entire pay event then posts a separate redistribution, even if the FOP has not changed. An original pay event or adjustment posting to a suspense FOP segment should be corrected by processing a labor redistribution using Banner form PZAREDS to correct the FOP segment. For original pay events (sequence 0), this usually occurs when the employee’s labor redistribution is set to a terminated C-FOP and is corrected through Human Resources Front End (HRFE) software. Additionally, the labor redistribution will need to be reversed using Banner form PZAREDS and posted back to the suspense FOP. Checking for balances on the suspense FOP can help determine if a correction is needed. Please contact UAFR if you are unsure if corrective action is needed.

The payroll system uses these dates in processing. For example , if there is an existing record for 1/1/2023 and a JLBD change with an effective date of 7/1/2023, there would be two components for the July monthly pay event (6/16/2023-7/15/2023). The 6/16-6/30 timeframe would pay using the CFOP information on the 1/1/2023 effective dated record, and the 7/1-7/15 timeframe would pay using the 7/1/2023 effective dated information. Impact to Accruals Accruals post for accrual pay events with a JLBD effective date greater than or equal to 7/1 of the new fiscal year. This does not apply to 9/12 employees as that calculation follows different rules. See Payroll Accruals section for how accruals are processed. Impact to Encumbrances If a future effective date is used, encumbrances will only calculate up to that future date. Best Practices to Avoid Known Banner Errors Please review JLBD changes thoroughly before posting them in the system. There is a known issue where not all required voids are posted if multiple changes to the same job are made within one pay period. If you believe your encumbrances are overstated due to this issue, contact uafrpayrollacctg@uillinois.edu for assistance with review and/or correction. The effective date in Banner form PZAREDS dictates the posting date of the redistribution transaction. That posting effective date is separate from the JLBD effective date used in HR Front End. Payroll Accruals Automated process using the existing Banner data to post accruals for pay events that are earned in one Fiscal Year (FY) and paid in the next. Every year MN 7 will be an accrual pay event with accruals posting as MN 999 Depending on the year there will be 1 or 2 BW accrual pay events. If an entire pay event was earned in the prior FY but paid in the next FY, accruals will post as BW 998. If a pay event is earned across two FY but paid in the next FY, accruals will post as BW 999. Accruals will zero out between FY’s (debit to expense in prior FY and credit to expense in following FY) Redistributions cannot be done for accrual transactions after the FY has closed but gross expense can be redistributed. If accrual pay events need to be moved you will look for the standard pay event number to redistribute (MN 7, BW 13, BW 14, BW 15) Training End Date Job Aid Start Date Job Aid Business and Finance For questions or concerns about the BusFin site, please contact sharedservices@uillinois.edu.

This will generally be the earliest of the following: End of the current Fiscal Year (or the Grant end date for multi-year encumbrances) Job end date in NBAJOBS Effective date of a future-dated job distribution record for that employee and job. Encumbrance balances will liquidate each pay period in the amount of the payroll expenses posted that pay period until the balance reaches zero. Timing of When Encumbrances Are Updated in Banner Encumbrances are only updated (recast) in Banner during a main payroll calculation (monthly or biweekly). Because of this, changes to encumbrances may take a few weeks to process in Banner. How to Update Encumbrances Encumbrances reflect the anticipated payroll expenses for a specific job so changes to encumbrances will process based on changing the job distribution record in HR Front End (HRFE) Labor Redistributions in Banner using form PZAREDS will not impact encumbrance balances since the expenses being moved have already been liquidated when the payroll initially posted. How to Close $0 Encumbrances Sometimes an encumbrance is fully liquidated with a $0 balance but has not been closed in the system. If grant related, please contact Grants. For all other funds email uafrpayrollacctg@uillinois.edu . Reviewing Payroll Encumbrances by Person and by Month Payroll Encumbrance reports are located in My UI Financials . Year End Encumbrance Processing For encumbrances that are encumbered on an annual basis, any encumbrance balance at year-end will be fully liquidated. Multi-year encumbrance (MYE) balances roll into the next fiscal year. Annual encumbrances will be recast when the first payroll of the next fiscal year is calculated.

A separate Fact Sheet is required to be completed and submitted for all self-supporting funds and health service plan funds. Any accrual, deferral, and/or inventory adjustments which are not recorded in the unit's normal accounting processes must be reported on the Fact Sheet to ensure that Banner accurately reflects the fund's financial condition as of June 30.

The Fact Sheet Excel Attachment is smart enough to do this for you, as long as the appropriate date ranges are entered.

The updated attachment can be used to track information related to these accruals and deferrals as they occur throughout the year (for example, when unearned revenue is received or when prepaid expenses are incurred).

For questions or contact information at Emburse Enterprise see: Emburse Enterprise Resources Taxability of Moving Expense Reimbursements All personal moving expenses reimbursed to or paid on behalf of an employee by the University of Illinois System are considered taxable income to the employee. Units should process invoices and expense reports through Emburse Enterprise and not by a purchase order. Moving expenses payments should be processed the same as other taxable fringe benefits. See Busfin Policies and Procedures Manual, 18.5 Fringe Benefits for additional information. Insurance of Personal Household Goods It is the employee's responsibility to contact the Federal Warehouse Company for any information regarding insurance coverage. Interstate Insurance (Household Goods) The agreement with the Federal Warehouse Company includes insurance coverage up to a maximum of $125,000 protection that is based on an established value of $7.00 per pound. This level of insurance is provided at no additional charge. In the event the employee believes the value of their household goods and university equipment exceeds the $7.00 per pound limit (maximum of $125,000), the employee is responsible for contacting the Federal Warehouse Company to purchase additional protection. Intrastate Insurance (Household Goods) For Intrastate moves, Illinois law only allows free coverage of $0.30 per pound per article. In the event additional coverage is needed of more than $0.30 per pound per article the new employee is responsible for contacting the Federal Warehouse Company to purchase any additional coverage. Tips for Relocation of Household Goods Before you move Contact the Federal Warehouse Companies coordinator, if either moving to the university or from the university. This will ensure that you receive the appropriate contract benefits. Properly dispose of hazardous materials. Do not include jewelry, money, coin collections, etc. in items to be handled by others. Keep these items in your possession. Notify carrier as soon as you know your move dates, preferably two to three weeks prior to date for actual schedule. Confirm dates and services to be performed with your Federal Warehouse Companies coordinator. Make a list of items in offsite storage, office, and laboratory locations. Make a list of boxes as well as furniture and garage items. Make a list of items in the attic, crawl spaces, closets, and any other storage areas that the moving consultant cannot view. Make a list of items that will require special handling. This includes glass tabletops, marble tops, taxidermy, and heavy mirrors or pictures that may need protective crating. Check the access for loading and unloading at each stop for the move. Will an 18-wheel tractor-trailer moving van be able to park legally and logistically within 75 feet of your front door? If it cannot, long carry and perhaps even shuttle charges (loading and unloading a smaller truck) may be incurred. Are there elevators or stairs at each location? There may be additional cost considerations at both origin and destination. Do not have the phone disconnected at origin until the house is empty. Communication is very important during the moving process. Provide phone numbers at destination including hotel, new home, cell, and work phone number. During Loading and Delivery Your shipment will be given a window of dates for loading and delivery. The duration of that window is dependent on the weight and distance of your shipment. Make sure you are present when loading and unloading occurs to ensure that all services are performed to your satisfaction. If you are not available in this time frame, waiting time charges may be incurred. Make sure at the time of loading that you check the inventory sheet before signing it. Check the entire residence at the origin before the truck leaves to ensure that nothing was left behind or was taken by mistake. At unloading, make sure to check off each item as it is delivered and make notations for loss or damage before signing the form. Tour the new residence before the driver leaves to ensure everything is in the right place. Ask the driver to assemble anything that has been disassembled and ensure that all parts are there. If part of your shipment goes to storage, be sure that items are clearly marked for the temporary residence and check these items off at destination. You have the right to be present each time your shipment is weighed. If you are moving an automobile, you must inspect it immediately at destination and file a claim, if necessary, within 24 hours of receiving the vehicle. Damage to household goods must be reported within their specified time. Relocation of University Equipment (i.e. Laboratory, Office, etc.) In the event Facilities and Services (F&S) cannot meet department requirements for local office and laboratory moves, the Federal Warehouse Company has offered discounted rates for these same services. The relocation of university equipment requires the issuance of a Purchase Order by the appropriate Purchasing & Contract Management Office. If using the Federal Warehouse Company, the department must submit a requisition and quotation to Purchasing. If you have decided to utilize a vendor other than Federal Warehouse Company, a Certificate of Insurance must be obtained meeting the minimum insurance requirements . Insurance of Lab and/or Office Equipment In the event the Federal Warehouse Company or another private mover provides relocation of university equipment, it is the department’s responsibility to contact the University Office of Risk Management for transit insurance. Taxability of Moving Expense Reimbursements Relocating university equipment to the university is not taxable to an employee, and invoices can be handled by the department representative creating a requisition in iBuy for a purchase order. Emburse Enterprise is not used for payment for the relocation of university equipment. Tips for Relocation of Laboratory or Office Equipment Contact Facilities and Services so an elevator (if needed) may be reserved and padded prior to arrival on campus. Work with University Property Management to ensure the received equipment is properly accounted for and labeled.

Please refer to the sections below for the relevant information about each university. UIUC UIC UIS University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign departments submit copier meter reads and/or annual agreement(s) for their equipment using the university's electronic procurement system ( iBuy ) non-catalog vendor forms. Once the department approves the iBuy order, iBuy will automatically email a purchase order for that meter read billing or annual agreement to the vendor. Note that each meter read will generate a new purchase order each month. The department must select a vendor that is associated with the piece of equipment. For office machine equipment not covered under a maintenance agreement that requires repair services (time and materials), the department must select a vendor from the OMR master contract list and pay for the repair services (time and materials) on a PCard. The Vendor Name and Contract Number must be the initial information in the Description line of the PCard Log. See Business and Finance Policies and Procedures Manual, 7.6 The University Purchasing Card (PCard) . Annual Maintenance Agreements Monthly Copier Meter Reads or One-Time Payments There are two types of copier annual maintenance agreements: Monthly Copier Meter Reads or One-Time Payments or A one-time payment at the beginning of the fiscal year that may have allotted copies with overage charges if the allotted copies are exceeded. note : If both methods are offered (meter reads or one-time payment) the department must choose one of the methods. Copier meter reads are submitted each month to the vendor using iBuy non-catalog vendor forms. Annual maintenance agreements are submitted at the beginning of each fiscal year using iBuy non-catalog vendor forms. Job Aids to process iBuy transactions are located below the Contracted Vendor pricing sheet and on the Business and Finance training website under Purchasing job aids Departments should contact the appropriate vendor that is associated with the piece of equipment when: Considering maintenance plan coverage for equipment An office machine needs service - either maintenance or repair service* There is a need to add or remove equipment *Note : When selecting the vendor for time and materials (repair service), you must use the vendor associated with the piece of equipment that needs repair, e.g., a Sharp copier that does not have a maintenance agreement would be repaired by either CDS Office Technologies or Watts Copy systems. RK Dixon Billing Process: Meter reads for Canon copiers in Urbana (both purchased and rental/lease) will be performed each month by RK Dixon staff (Ron Oldani). RK Dixon will submit the invoice data on a spreadsheet to Purchasing and University Payables for processing. Each month your Canon copier meter read charges will be posted directly to your financial statement with the description of: 'model'/'serial'<space>'start'/'end'@$'rate'. What does this mean for your department? Your department no longer needs to take a monthly meter read for any Canon copiers (purchased or leased/rented) and submit an iBuy requisition! Each month, the transaction information will be posted in spreadsheet format below for reconciliation purposes. Below are some FAQ's how this program will work. If you have any questions regarding this program, please use the Service Desk Request Form . Q. Who should I contact if I have questions about my charge? A. Resolution of charges should begin with contacting Connie Lasek with RK Dixon at 800-553-0020. Q. Can I contact the Urbana Purchasing Department with customer service issues? A. Yes, the department may contact the Urbana Purchasing Department with any billing or customer service issues for charges or questions. The department may be referred to RK Dixon for billing questions and resolution. Please submit an AITS Service Desk Ticket to allow the inquiry to be distributed among Urbana Purchasing staff. Q. I bought a new Canon copier, how do I activate my maintenance service? A. The purchase of a new Canon copier comes with a 90-day warranty. RK Dixon will make arrangements with the department to take a meter read when the 90-day warranty period ends. This meter read becomes the beginning meter read to calculate the next month's copier meter charge that will appear on the department's financial statement. Q. What happens if I want to surplus or trade-in my Canon copier? A. If a department plans to surplus or trade-in the Canon copier that is on a maintenance agreement with monthly meter read, the department must contact RK Dixon to terminate the maintenance agreement and allow a reasonable amount of time for RK Dixon to conduct a final meter read on the copier. If the department does not contact RK Dixon and allow a final meter read on the copier, RK Dixon has the right to calculate a reasonably estimated final meter read and the charges will be posted directly to the department’s C-FOP in the monthly cycle.

Terms of Sale Responsibility for Cost and Transit Ownership Procedures Destination, freight prepaid Seller - Pays Freight Cost Seller - Bears freight Cost Seller - Owns goods in transit Seller - Files claim Department Procedures The department will communicate with the seller to ensure that the seller agrees to pay the shipping and freight costs and add the FOB (terms to the quote when possible.) The department needs to review the quote to ensure the term reflects the responsibility and of shipping/freight costs before processing the requisition for the purchase. When processing the iBuy requisition, the department should select the appropriate FOB code. University Payables Procedures University Payables will not process invoiced shipping/freight for purchase orders which contain an FOB code that indicates freight is not payable by the university. Typically, this is FOB 31. If the vendor wants to add shipping/freight charges and the department contests the shipping/freight costs, the issue should be forwarded to Purchasing for review and resolution. If shipping/freight is added for payment: A change order request is required to add the shipping/freight costs to the purchase order total to allow for payment to the vendor. Destination, prepaid and add Seller - Pays freight costs and adds costs to invoice. Buyer - Bears freight costs. Seller - Owns goods in transit. Seller - Files claims (if any). Department Procedures The department will obtain a quote with the shipping/freight term and costs identified on the quote. The department will include the cost of shipping/freight with the total cost on the requisition and select FOB Shipping Point. University Payables Procedures University Payables will process invoiced shipping/freight costs for purchase orders which contain an FOB code that indicates that freight costs are payable by the university (typically FOB 30). If a shipping/freight line is present on the purchase order and there needs to be an increase in the shipping/freight line-item amount, the department will need to submit a change request to Purchasing, requesting additional funds for the PO shipping/freight line. Shipping Point (All types) Specific terms to be discussed with Purchasing Department Procedures The department obtains a quote with the FOB ""shipping point"" terms. Purchasing Procedures When the buyer sees shipping/freight point being utilized, the buyer will contact the department and ensure that the department is aware of the university shipping/freight contract. The buyer will consult with the department on the most appropriate shipping/freight methods. The final decision will remain with the department. If the university shipping/freight contract is utilized, the buyer will cross out any shipping/freight costs on quote and attach the university shipping/freight instructions.

The RFP is awarded to the supplier who best meets the qualifications and criteria specified in the RFP. It differs from a Sealed Bid because it allows more flexibility. It may involve negotiating technical requirements, scheduling, type of contract, terms and conditions, and price, including best and final offers. In contrast, a Sealed bid is awarded to the lowest responsible bidder.

Clearly written and properly organized specifications establish technical goals and administrative and financial expectations as well as set the tone for good communication and a productive relationship between the university and the supplier/contractor. To accomplish this, the specifications must clearly define the user's needs. Specifications should include the following: Background and purpose for the requested goods or services Scope of work describing the service and/or product including accompanying mandatory and desirable requirements, quantity and units, desired delivery dates or schedules, and technical requirements Clear description of the deliverables to be provided by the supplier Pricing format Basis for evaluation: when specifying requirements, always consider how that requirement will be evaluated and measured Department's plan for monitoring the performance of the supplier Related Forms Solicitation Forms How RFPs are Advertised, Processed, and Awarded RFPs must be advertised for a minimum of 15 days on the Illinois Procurement Bulletin in order to be in compliance with the Illinois Procurement Code .

What is an ""Emergency""? An emergency is defined as a situation involving public health, public safety, or cases where immediate expenditure is necessary for repairs to State property to protect against further loss of or damage, to prevent or minimize serious disruption in State services, or to ensure the integrity of State records. Emergency conditions may result from fires, explosions, adverse weather conditions, or epidemic conditions. They may also result from untimely breakdown, damage, or loss of equipment vital to the maintenance of health or safety standards. Making an Emergency Purchase The Purchasing Division should be contacted as soon as a department determines that an emergency purchasing situation exists. Timeline of Emergency Purchases The term of the emergency purchase shall be limited to the time reasonably needed for a competitive procurement, not to exceed 90 calendar days. A contract may be extended beyond 90 calendar days with the approval of the Chief Procurement Officer for Higher Education. In true emergency situations, Section 20-30 of the Illinois Procurement Code provides that purchasing procedures, including bidding requirements, may be waived if it becomes important for an emergency transaction to be completed within a certain time. Effort is made to accelerate or modify normal procedures to accommodate an emergency rather than to eliminate a procedure. Examples of such efforts include requesting quotations verbally or by email. Oversight and Reporting of Emergency Purchases The Director of Purchasing is responsible for ensuring that in emergencies, the normal pattern for reviewing and approving purchases is maintained and the purchasing processes are accelerated and expedited. Emergency procurement notices are published in the Illinois Procurement Bulletin for Public Institutions of Higher Education. The Purchasing Division is responsible for preparing statements that must be filed with the Auditor General of the State of Illinois and the Chief Procurement Officer (CPO). These statements must be filed no later than five business days after an emergency purchase has been made. The President, after consulting with each member of the executive committee of the Board of Trustees who can reasonably be contacted, may approve emergency transactions in excess of the Board limit on behalf of the Board of Trustees and report the same promptly to the Board. If the amount of the emergency transaction exceeds such dollar amounts as the Board of Trustees may specify from time to time, the President must consult with all Board members who can reasonably be contacted before approving the emergency action.

A sole source procurement for an estimated purchase equal to or greater than the Small Purchase Limits is permissible when a requirement is available from only a single supplier/contractor or when only one supplier/contractor is deemed economically feasible. A requirement for a particular proprietary item does not justify a sole source procurement if there is more than one potential bidder or offer or authorized to provide that item. Advertisement of Sole Source Procurements Public Hearing Sole source procurements for which the total cost equals or exceeds the dollar level for requiring a state mandated competitive selection process, (see Small Purchase Limits / Competitive Solicitation Thresholds for more details) must be advertised on the Illinois Higher Education Procurement Bulletin for a minimum of 14 days, after which a public hearing must be held before the award can be processed, or before proceeding with a competitive process. The public hearing is for the purpose of receiving relevant information from interested person(s) and/or entity(s). At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall review the university's determination, any information obtained from the public (written or verbally), the applicable sections of the Illinois Procurement Code and Rules and any other information deemed relevant. The Hearing Officer shall make a written finding and recommendation to the Chief Procurement Officer – Higher Education. The Chief Procurement Officer shall, after considering the Hearing Officer's recommendation, will make a decision in writing to uphold or overturn, in whole or in part, the university's decision. The public hearing results will be posted to the Bulletin. If no other supplier challenges this sole source determination within the 14-day posting period and it is determined that the purchase is a sole source, a contract may be executed with the sole source supplier. The sole source will then be posted as an award to the Bulletin. If a challenge is received and the public hearing results in the determination that the purchase is not a sole source, the sole source intent will be canceled on the Bulletin and Purchasing will commence with a competitive solicitation process. Due diligence and careful review of the sole source is necessary prior to posting to the Bulletin. The Purchasing Department will complete such processes expeditiously. Refer to the Sole Source Hearings Schedule on the Chief Procurement Office for Public Institutions of Higher Education (CPO-HE) website to view dates for upcoming hearings. The requirement for a public hearing will add a minimum of three weeks to the sole source approval process. The requirement for a public hearing will add a minimum of three weeks to the sole source approval process. Oversight and Review Sole Source awards are subject to review by the Procurement Policy Board (PPB) and the Commission on Equity & Inclusion (CEI) . Source purchases in excess of the Board of Trustees (BOT) authorization level require additional time for processing. At these dollar levels, departments should allow an additional eight to twelve weeks for completion of the BOT approval process. See the Board of Trustees Schedule and Approval Thresholds for meeting dates, Board approval thresholds, and deadlines for submission of documents to Purchasing. Who to Ask If the requisitioning department believes that they have a sole source procurement, they should complete the Sole Source Justification Form and submit it to the following: UIUC: urbanapurchasing@uillinois.edu UIC: uicpurchasing@uillinois.edu UIS: uispurchasing@uillinois.edu System-Level Offices (Chart 9): procurement@uillinois.edu Purchasing will review the information to determine if the procurement meets the requirements of a sole source purchase. If it is determined that the procurement does not meet the requirements of a sole source purchase, the Sealed Bid/RFP process must be used to select a supplier/contractor. Refer to the Business and Financial Services Policies and Procedures Manual, Section 7 for Commodities and General Services or for Professional and Artistic Services. For guidelines and approximate timeframes, contact the Purchasing Division.

Please view the Commodity Codes Job Aid for detailed instructions on how to use commodity codes. iBuy - Completing the Purchase Requisition Form iBuy - Completing the Standing Order Form Why Do We Use Commodity Codes? Commodity codes are essential for accurate reporting and accounting. They help classify purchases, track assets, and determine the lifespan of items for depreciation. Using the correct code ensures precise financial data and effective asset management. What is a Commodity Code? A commodity code is a standard classification system used to categorize equipment and other assets purchased by the university. These codes ensure that each item is assigned the correct useful life for financial reporting and depreciation purposes. Using the correct commodity code is essential for accurately classifying and tracking university assets. Through uniform coding and other management mechanisms, NIGP Commodity Codes assist with data analytics and classification of purchases. What are NIGP Commodity Codes? NIGP Commodity Codes are a standardized coding system designed to organize and streamline procurement processes. When integrated with procurement software, NIGP Commodity Codes ensure consistent categorization of goods and services, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of procurement programs. What is NIGP? NIGP, the National Institute of Governmental Purchasing. NIGP’s mission is to develop, support and promote the public procurement profession. Major Class Codes and Their Importance Major Class Codes represent the broadest categories used to classify purchases, serving as an overarching framework for organizing items. Each Major Class Code encompasses a range of individual commodity codes, which provide more specific details about the item. For example, if you were purchasing oranges, the Major Class Code would be 01900 (Agricultural Crops and Grains, including Fruits, Melons, Nuts, and Vegetables). The specific Commodity Code for oranges would then be 01941 , which identifies the item as Fruits , Citrus . This hierarchical structure ensures clarity and consistency in classifying purchases, making it easier to manage and track procurement data.

Instructions for how vendors can submit purchase order invoices are available on the Information for Vendors page. Processing Banner/BDM Purchase order (PO) invoices and credit memos are scanned and loaded into Banner Document Management (BDM) for processing by the Invoice Processing Center. Due to the daily volume received (approximately 1,300 documents per day), this process could take up to 5 business days. Invoices are reviewed by University Payables (UPAY) and processed by receipt/load date, oldest to newest, in accordance with the terms of the PO. The current BDM processing date is posted daily on the Payables Processing Status page. Units can search the invoices and credit memos in BDM by vendor invoice number, PO number, or invoice amount. Once a UPAY team member has started processing an invoice or credit memo in Banner, the unit can view the document in Banner FOIDOCH as well. Transition to iBuy Starting May 15, 2025, select non-catalog invoices will be available exclusively in iBuy. Current invoice submission and processing will be moved from Banner/BDM to iBuy in phases, with the goal of all non-catalog invoices loaded and processed in iBuy. Documentation for invoices previously processed in Banner/BDM will remain in BDM for review. iBuy The Digital Mailroom will scan and load invoices and credit memos into iBuy within 48 hours of receipt. iBuy documents will route through established iBuy invoice workflow. If a PO or invoice issue is identified, the invoice will route to a UPAY approval queue for review, and UPAY will contact the unit via an iBuy Comment for further assistance. All approved iBuy invoices and credit memos will export to Banner for payment issuance. Payment Payment is issued in accordance with the terms of the PO. Payment methods include ACH/direct deposit, wire transfer, ePayables (virtual credit card payments), and paper check. Once issued, payment information is available in Banner FOIDOCH or Banner FAIVNDH, and payment information will populate in iBuy in the Payment Information section of the invoice or credit memo. Unpaid/Rejected Invoices UPAY priority is to process complete and accurate invoices in the open queue. If a unit or vendor submits an invoice for payment and that invoice does not appear in Banner, current technology does not allow units to be notified when an invoice is rejected. However, units can search in BDM by the vendor's invoice number, invoice date and/or the invoice amount. If the vendor invoice has rejected, the Banner Invoice Number ('I' number in BDM) will be INVREJCT. Invoices scanned and loaded into BDM may be rejected for various reasons: Duplicate vendor invoice number Duplicate invoice submittal PO number is inaccurate or incomplete PO is closed or cancelled If a unit finds that an invoice has been rejected, they should: Review the invoice to determine the missing or incorrect information (you can find a list of what information should be on an invoice under ""Submitting Invoices"" on the Information for Vendors page) The most common reasons why invoices are rejected include: duplicate vendor invoice number purchase order is closed highlighted information, red ink or red text (which often cannot be read by scanning equipment) Email obfsupay@uillinois.edu with the correct information and the invoice will be processed according to the PO terms. For access to BDM, please contact your Unit Security Contact (USC). For additional information about BDM, please review the job aids, Banner Document Management (BDM) Basics . Invoices on Hold or in Process There are instances where invoices may be put on hold due to lack of necessary information or if they do not match their corresponding PO. The most common reasons for invoices to be put on hold are tolerance issues or vendor ID or remittance address issues. For BDM invoices, an automated email will be sent to the unit (see below). For iBuy invoices, the unit will receive an email based on an iBuy Comment on the iBuy invoice. Automated and Manual Email Codes UPAY sends automated emails for the majority of BDM invoice holds. Those emails are driven by the hold code entered in the UREF1 field in BDM, and are sent to the PO requestor, unit financial manager, and the appropriate Purchasing office. Automated Email Codes D-DUPSHIP: This invoice appears to be a duplicate shipment D-ITMADD: This invoice contains a line item(s) which does not appear on the purchase order. D-OVR50K: University Payables must have a unit email approval for all invoices over $50,000 on a standing order D-OVRTOL: The invoice amount exceeds the amount remaining on the PO. For Banner regular orders and iBuy standing orders, the invoice will be processed for payment unless an invoice line exceeds the corresponding PO line by either 10% or $150 when the lower threshold of the two is exceeded. Banner standing orders are subject to the same thresholds but are evaluated on the PO total. D-PRICE: This invoice contains a line item(s) which does not match the price(s) listed on the purchase order D-SUB: This invoice contains a line item(s) which appears to be a substitutions(s) for a commodity listed on the purchase order D-UOM: This invoice contains a line item(s) which appear to be of a different unit of measure than that listed on the purchase order D-WRGPO: The purchase order referenced on invoice is assigned to another vendor P-WRGVID: This purchase order references an incorrect vendor ID D-OVRBID: This is a Bid Order and requires buyer approval P-FRTNA: FOB terms on the purchase order do not allow payment of freight charges D-NONCONF: Invoice, order, shipping, service date occurs before the purchase order transaction date D-IBUYFR: Invoiced freight amount exceeds the iBuy PO amount D-EXPST: Expired state funds U-WIRE: A wire transfer payment may be required There are instances where UPAY must provide more specific information to the originating unit, and manual emails are constructed and sent. Units are encouraged to respond to these emails rather than beginning a new email string so that UPAY can identify these responses and efficiently forward to the appropriate group for processing. Manual Email Codes D-POCAN: The purchase order has been cancelled D-POCL: The purchase order is closed P-INCPO: The purchase order is incomplete P-NEWFYPO: The purchase order referenced on the invoice is expired. Please provide a current valid PO number. D-CREDIT: Hold for credit or to determine the validity of credit D-VIF: New vendor information form is needed D-DPTREQ: Invoice placed on hold per department request U-APISSUE: Invoice has an issue that needs to be handled by UPAY U-EFFROLL: PO needs to roll to next fiscal year before payment can be made U-P&D Address on invoice needs to be added to vendor record D-BOT: Increase of PO needs approval by the Board of Trustees Training Banner Document Management Basics Related Links Information for Vendors Electronic Invoicing Special Payment Requests iBuy Resource Page Banner information Policies 8 Payments and Reimbursements Business and Finance For questions or concerns about the BusFin site, please contact sharedservices@uillinois.edu.

Follow the instructions listed in the Completing a PO Special Payment Request Form job aid . The Purchase Order Special Payment Request Form is used to request: Prepayment or down-payment on purchase orders, when the down payment is part of the terms and pricing negotiated by Purchasing. A deposit requires a separate line on the purchase order.

Payments for protected information invoices, or to use a summary page for large invoices (over 50 pages). Wire transfers for international purchase order payments or when a wire transfer is required contractually. The EFT form is also required for PO wire transfers. Note: Special Payment Requests should only be used as an exception for payments that require one of these special needs. It is not to be used as a daily payment process. Forms received by University Payables which do not meet the above criteria will be processed per the terms established on the purchase order. Check pick up will not be available unless a valid business reason as to why the check cannot be mailed is provided with the Special Payment Request Form. Processing Incomplete forms and forms without substantiating documentation will be returned to the requestor. University Payables Payment Operations will make every effort to process payment in a timely manner. Units should submit requests as soon as possible to avoid delays. If a sufficient business purpose has been provided and approved by Payables, Special Payment Request checks will be printed for pickup at Urbana-Champaign or Chicago only. Invoice Payments by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) Electronic Fund transfer (EFT) (also known as Wire Transfers or ACH Payments) are initiated through University Payables by the submission of an original completed and signed Electronic Fund Transfer Form along with the original Request a General Encumbrance/Wire Transfer Payment with back up documentation attached of original vendor invoice, purchase order, or contract. The Electronic Fund Transfer Form is used to: Send payment by EFT in US or foreign currency. Send a draft payment in a foreign currency (check).

However, if the fax is illegible, processing delays can occur. All original signed documents must be retained in the department files and available for audit review. Requirements on Electronic Fund Transfers (EFT) to European and Middle Eastern Countries Most EFT payments to European or Middle Eastern countries will require an IBAN number. The IBAN (International Bank Account Number) is a standardized format for a number that includes the country identifier, bank identifier, branch identifier and personal bank account. The IBAN should not be confused with the bank's SWIFT code that identifies only the receiving bank. The SWIFT code is also required for a successful EFT to foreign countries. The Electronic Fund Transfer Form has a field to accommodate this requirement. Failure to provide the IBAN will result in processing delays until an appropriate IBAN can be obtained. Please note that foreign draft requests do not require the use of an IBAN.

Departments should establish a process whereby all required receiving records are routinely entered into the Banner system. Failure to complete departmental receiving requirements within University and State policies, and the payment terms stated on the PO or contract, results in one or more of the following university-wide consequences: Vendor credit hold on all pending unshipped orders for all campuses Late payment penalties charged to the department Price increases on future orders Loss of negotiated prompt payment discounts Damaged vendor relations Receiving Process Basics Payment of a PO Invoice is put on hold awaiting Banner receiving (""receipt required status"") when: Any single invoice of $50,000 or more is processed in Banner for payment against a regular Banner PO or an iBuy PO (either regular or standing). The Banner system defaults automatically to receipt required status for all invoices of $50,000 or more. NOTE: This default goes into effect even if your department issues the order as ""no receipt required."" A department submits a requisition for a PO in Banner and identifies it as ""receipt required,"" regardless of the invoice amount or default setting. The receipt required option is currently not available for iBuy requisitions. However, if an invoice for an iBuy order is $50,000 or more, it will still trigger the Banner receiving process when the invoice is completed in Banner. Departments should enter all received PO items into Banner Receiving on the same day the shipped goods or services are received or accepted, assuring that the invoice matches the purchase order. Internal lines of communication should be set-up to accomplish this requirement within the payment terms of the purchase order. Departments must resolve PO Invoices pending receipt in Banner as soon as possible after goods are received. Otherwise, the transaction remains incomplete as ""in process,"" and not posted for payment in Banner.

Deductions and Net Pay When calculating your pay, you need to consider your earnings, taxable income, and deductions. Here's how it works: Start with your Earnings , which is the total amount of money you earned from wages or paid leave. This is your pay before any taxes or deductions are taken out. Add any taxable benefits to your Earnings and then subtract any non-taxable deductions. This will give you your Taxable Income , which is used to determine tax withholdings. Once taxes and deductions are calculated, you can determine your Net Pay by subtracting all deductions from your Earnings . Deductions may include taxes, mandatory deductions, and any voluntary deductions you have chosen. The remaining amount is your Net Pay , which is the actual money you will receive in your bank account or as a paycheck. Payroll deductions fall into one of the following categories: Voluntary Deductions Payroll checks or deposits include many different voluntary deductions. The deductions would fall into the following categories: Benefit Deductions Many employees are eligible for benefits that are deducted from payroll earnings. All questions regarding these deductions should be directed to UPB at the University Payroll & Benefits Service Portal . Insurance: such as health, dental, life, disability Flexible spending accounts and health savings plan Supplemental retirement plans Optional State benefits Campus Recreation Employees that have membership in a campus recreation center may have deductions taken directly from earnings. Any questions regarding this deduction should be directed to the campus recreation center. Charity Deductions Employees may contribute to a variety of charitable organizations via payroll deduction as part of the State and University Employees Combined Appeal (SECA). For information, please see: Chicago: Charitable Giving at UIC Springfield: State and University Employees Combined Appeal Urbana/Champaign: Campus Charitable Fund Drive Parking Employees holding parking permits for campus parking may have deductions taken directly from earnings. Any questions regarding this deduction should be directed to the applicable parking office ( Directory - University of Illinois System ). Union Dues Employees may request to have dues withheld or revoked through their labor union. Any questions regarding this deduction should be directed to the respective union. Voluntary Agreements Employees may discover that an Illinois State Offset Accounts Receivable deduction has been imposed (displayed as IL State Offset - Accts Rec on the earnings statement). In some cases, the employee can arrange for a voluntary deduction agreement to be set up, usually to reduce the withholding amount for each payroll. UPB does not have any information or control over Illinois State Offset deductions. Employees must work with the agency that initiated the deduction. Employee Instructions: If unsure of the state agency money is owed to, contact the State Comptroller to inquire. 312-814-2451 or 217-782-7525 Contact the state agency and discuss the possibility of making repayment arrangements directly with the agency. After an amount is agreed upon, complete a Voluntary Payroll Deduction Agreement form and send it to University Payroll & Benefits (UPB). Instructions are provided on the form. UPB will set up a voluntary deduction according to this agreement effective the next available pay period. The voluntary deduction will continue until (a) the agency sends a release or (b) a Revocation Form is submitted to stop the deduction. Agency Release: upon completion of the agreement, the agency will send a release to UPB. The deduction will be stopped. Revocation Form: the employee may submit a Revocation Form at any time to stop the deduction. The revocation form is submitted online directly to UPB. If the debt has not been satisfied, the Illinois State Offset deduction will be reinstated by the State Comptroller. The person listed as the agency contact is the only one who can inform the State Comptroller to stop the Illinois State Offset deduction. The agency controls when the involuntary deduction from the state will stop. If you have questions about setting up a voluntary agreement, contact UPB through the University Payroll & Benefits Service Portal . Involuntary Deductions Involuntary deductions are required by court order or other legal means to recover a debt or obligation owed by the employee. University Payroll & Benefits (UPB) is required to withhold these deductions until officially released. Employees cannot stop involuntary deductions. Question regarding most involuntary deductions may be directed to UPB at the University Payroll & Benefits Service Portal . Note: UPB does not have any information or control over Illinois State Offset deductions. Below are listed the most common involuntary deductions. Child Support If an employee is past due on child support payments, a court or state agency can order withholding from the employee's pay. UPB must withhold according to the court order (up to 50% of allowable disposable income). The deduction will continue until a release is received from the court or issuing agency indicating a change in amount or cessation of withholding. Child support orders are primarily transmitted through the electronic Income Withholding Orders (e-IWO) service. Deduction will be listed as Child Support on the earnings statement. Child support withholding takes priority over other involuntary deductions, except a pre-existing federal tax levy. Illinois State Offset Deductions An individual who owes money to any state agency for more than 90 days will be subject to the Illinois State Offset accounts receivable deduction. The agency sends the debt to the Illinois State Comptroller's Office, who will attempt to collect the debt from any payment issued by a State of Illinois institution, including the University of Illinois System. An interface between the Illinois State Comptroller and the payroll system will automatically set up a deduction for debt recovery as follows: Deduction will be listed as IL State Offset - Accts Rec on the earnings statement. Deduction amount is 25% of disposable pay (gross pay minus legally required deductions). In some cases, the employee can arrange for a voluntary deduction agreement to be set up in place of the state offset, usually to reduce the withholding amount each payroll. See the Voluntary Agreements section above for more information. Illinois State Offset deductions are mandated by State Comptroller Act [15 ILCS 405/10.05 and 405/1005a] and Illinois Administrative Code 285.1104. UPB does not have any information or control over Illinois State Offset deductions. To inquire about the debt, the employee must contact the Illinois State Comptroller's office at 217-785-2463 or 217-782-7525. Federal Tax Levies Federal Tax Levies are wage garnishments issued by the federal government for the collection of an employee's earnings for unpaid federal taxes. Federal tax levies are different than most involuntary deductions because the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) takes all the employee's pay except for any amounts which are exempt from the levy. The employee will receive this exempt amount as take-home pay, which is calculated according to the table in Publication 1494 . The employee must return Form 668-W(c) to UPB with the completed Statement of Dependents and Filing Status within three days, or payment will be figured according to the table section indicating filing status: Married Filing Separately with no dependents (zero). NOTE: This filing status is not related to the Form W-4 filed by the employee. The wage levy will continue until the balance is paid or the University receives a release from the IRS. UPB cannot alter the deduction amount and withholds according to IRS requirement. This deduction will be listed as Federal Tax Levy on the earnings statement. Garnishments A garnishment is a court ordered deduction that the University of Illinois System must honor, for monies owed to a company or an individual. Therefore, UPB needs to receive another court order to terminate or make changes. The deduction will begin as soon as we receive the garnishment order. The amount of the deduction is the lesser of: 15% of gross pay minus retirement OR Gross minus retirement, federal & state taxes, OASDI and Medicare minus (45 times the federal minimum wage). This deduction will be listed as Garnishment on the earnings statement. UPB cannot take a garnishment deduction that will result in an employee taking home less than minimum wage. The deduction will continue until it is paid in full (including interest), and a release is received from the attorney that issued the garnishment. The deduction amount is calculated based on the employee's pay status along with a deductions calculation provided to the court and the garnishment attorney. If an employee is under bankruptcy protection or is in the process of filing, the bankruptcy attorney should be instructed to fax an Automatic Stay to the UPB office fax at 312-996-6542. This will terminate the garnishment deductions. Any money deducted after the date the bankruptcy was filed will be refunded to the employee. Any money withheld before the filing will be held until a Stipulation to Dismiss is received from the garnishment attorney. NOTE: Wage assignments are not honored by the University of Illinois System. Only court ordered wage garnishments will be accepted. State Tax Levies Illinois Tax Levies are wage garnishments issued by the Illinois Department of Revenue for the collection of an employee's earnings for unpaid Illinois taxes. State tax levies follow the same calculation and bankruptcy rules as garnishments (see above). This deduction will be listed as IL Dept of Rev on the earnings statement. Tax Deductions Federal Tax Withholding Federal taxes are calculated according to an employee's Form W-4 Employee's Withholding Certificate as completed during the new hire process or via My UI Info . State Tax Withholding State taxes are calculated according to an employee's Form IL-W-4 Employee's Illinois Withholding Certificate as completed during the new hire process or via My UI Info . If working outside of the state of Illinois, please refer to the Employee’s Withholding Certificate webpage to determine the appropriate steps to take in order to have the correct state tax withholding applied. FICA Tax Withholding The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), mandates tax contributions into two federal insurance programs for many employees. FICA withholdings and earnings are reported to the Social Security Administration on Form W-2. Social Security (OASDI) Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) is more commonly known as Social Security. University employees who are eligible for the State Universities Retirement System ( SURS ) are exempt from OASDI withholding, as they contribute to SURS instead. A total of 12.4% of earnings subject to OASDI is contributed, divided equally between the employee and employer. Medicare Employees hired by the university after April 1, 1986 are subject to Medicare withholdings. A total of 2.9% of earnings subject to Medicare is contributed, divided equally between the employee and employer. The withholding amount for the employee is 1.45% plus 0.9% for wages in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. The university, as the employer, matches an additional 1.45%. Student FICA Exception Under Internal Revenue Code §3121(b)(10), students enrolled in institutions of higher education may qualify for the student FICA exception on their earnings. Additional information can be found on the Student Employee FICA Exception page. Foreign National Nonresident Aliens Under Internal Revenue Code §3121(b)(19), nonresident aliens in a F-1, J-1, M-1, or Q-1 status are generally not subject to FICA. To determine eligibility for the exemption, foreign nationals must complete a Tax Status Review. Tax Status Reviews can be scheduled here: Tax Status Review . SURS and Retirement Deductions State University Retirement System (SURS) The State Universities Retirement System (SURS) is a state-wide system for Illinois public universities that provides retirement, disability, and related benefits to eligible participants and annuitants. Contributions to SURS are mandatory if you are eligible. See State Universities Retirement System (SURS) - System Human Resources for more information. Most employees contribute 8% of their salary, while fire and police employees contribute 9.5%. The university provides a contribution portion which differs with each plan. Employees that contribute to SURS do not contribute to the Old Age Survivor and Death Insurance (OASDI) portion (6.2%) of FICA, also known as Social Security. The deduction from the employee's gross pay is pre-tax and is not included in Wages, tips or other compensation on Form W-2. Participation in SURS is indicated in Box 13 of Form W2, which will show the Retirement plan box checked. For more information regarding the plans, contact SURS . Supplemental Retirement Plans Supplemental 403b and Deferred Compensation 457 retirement plans are available to eligible employees. Participation is voluntary and may be started or stopped at any time. Pre-tax and post-tax options are available. Deductions will be pre-tax or post-tax according to the option you participate in.

Federal Form W-4 Employee's Withholding Certificate Federal income tax is calculated according to an employee's Form W-4 Withholding Certificate. UPB withholds an amount of income tax based on the marital status, number of dependents, and additional withholdings indicated on your completed Form W-4. You may indicate a whole dollar amount to be withheld in addition to the required withholding. If Form W-4 is not submitted, UPB withholds income tax at the rate for a single person with no dependents. If your tax status changes, you must submit a new Form W-4 that reflects those changes (see Update Your Withholding Certificate above). The most recent Form W-4 remains effective until updated. You should either contact your tax advisor or use the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator to determine how to complete your Form W-4. File Exempt You may file exempt from federal income tax if you meet the following conditions: Last year I had a right to a refund of all federal income tax withheld because I had no tax liability and This year I expect a refund of all federal income tax withheld because I expect to have no tax liability If you plan to file Exempt, you must submit a new Form W-4 that selects the exemption. This exemption must be renewed each year by submitting a new Form W-4 by February 15.

The proper and timely completion of each step by the employing department, the Office of Human Resources or the appropriate HR Service Center, and the University Payroll & Benefits (UPB) office is critical to ensuring that faculty and staff are paid on the scheduled pay date. Follow the Payroll Schedule to meet all deadlines. See Decoding the Payroll Schedule for more information. Human Resources Front End (HRFE) training can be found on the HR Front End page. For assistance with this process, contact the appropriate Human Resources office. Step 1: Review Job Records for Accuracy New hire jobs and changes to existing employment must be entered and routed in HRFE. Departments and HR should follow the Payroll Schedule to meet all HRFE transaction deadlines. Payroll is calculated according to job record data at the moment of the Job System Change Cutoff identified in the Payroll Schedule. For all categories of employees, verify the job’s effective date, termination date, and Full Time Equivalent (FTE) are accurate. Check the job hourly rate and salary for accuracy. In addition, the three categories of bi-weekly employees need specific elements of the job records to be verified. Civil Service Exempt – Default earnings must be set up (there should be no work schedule). Civil Service Non-Exempt – Work schedule must be set up (there should be no default earnings). Extra Help/Student Employees – These should never have default earnings or a work schedule set up on their jobs. NOTE: Feeder employees of any category should never have default earnings or a work schedule set up on their jobs. Step 2: Set Up and Maintain the Time Reporting Structure Each department needs to set up a payroll reporting structure. This includes setting up timesheet orgs, routing queues, and maintaining unit security. Structures should be set up so employees cannot approve their own timesheets. See the Time Entry and Approval Security course and the following job aids for more information. Web Time Entry 9x Resources Working with Routing Queues in Banner Overriding a Routing Queue (NBAJQUE) Web Time Entry 9x - Adding and Removing Proxy Users Tips for Unit Security Contacts and Superusers on how to create, maintain & troubleshoot the time approval routing queue in Banner Step 3: Process Time Entry for Bi-weekly Employees To ensure that bi-weekly employees are paid on the scheduled pay date, time entry originators must submit timesheets in time for approvers to meet the noon time entry cutoff identified in the Payroll Schedule (5 p.m. for superusers). Pay period beginning and ending dates, payroll calculation dates, and pay dates are identified in the payroll schedule. For bi-weekly payroll, departments use one of three methods for populating Banner with time reporting data: Web time entry requires the employee to enter and submit time in an online timesheet. The department approver reviews and approves the timesheet online or in Banner prior to the time entry cutoff identified in the Payroll Schedule. Web time is the preferred time entry method. Department time entry requires the department originator to extract timesheets in Banner and key in time according to the paper or digital timesheet provided by the employee. The department approver reviews the timesheet and approves it in Banner prior to the time entry cutoff identified in the Payroll Schedule. Feeder units use their own clocking system to report time. Payroll data gets “fed” into Banner according to the deadlines on the Payroll Schedule. NOTE: Stringent guidelines and requirements must be met before a unit is approved to become a feeder for time reporting. See the Mass Time Entry Feeder Requests forms. For time entry job aids and training materials, see UPB Time Reporting Resources . Step 4: Verify and Adjust Employee Pay Errors identified during the Current Pay Adjustment Window can be corrected with a Current Pay Adjustment (CPA) in the Payroll Adjustment Request Interface System (PARIS). All other errors can be corrected with a Prior Underpayment Adjustment (PUA) in PARIS or with a transaction in the Adjustment Notification Application (ANA). Payroll reports are available in Mobius View three days prior to the pay date. These reports can help you determine if you need an adjustment. Find information on Mobius View, how to view, print, and download the payroll reports in the Payroll Reports Guide . See the Payroll Adjustment Processing page and review the guides for Payroll Correction and Adjustments to learn about the corrections that can be made during the payroll payment process. Request a Payroll Loan When significant changes in jobs are not completed in Banner or new hire paperwork and job setup is delayed, it is possible the scheduled payroll deadlines will not be met. Also, payroll adjustments are not possible until job records are available or updated. In this situation, departments may request a payroll loan for an eligible employee to ensure the employee will be paid on or near the scheduled pay date. The procedure to request a payroll loan is managed by University Payroll & Benefits. The updated process is explained in the job aid Requesting a Pay Loan . Units/departments must submit an Expedited Payment Request (EPR) in Emburse Enterprise. A signed Pay Loan Request form and HRFE substantiation must be uploaded into Emburse Enterprise.

The department must submit an approved adjustment request to make corrections according to the payroll adjustment schedules. Adjustment Schedules During Payroll Calculation Bi-weekly timesheet errors identified after the timesheet has been approved during the Current Pay Adjustment Window can be corrected with a Current Pay Adjustment (CPA) in the Payroll Adjustment Request Interface System (PARIS). See the Payroll Schedule for the CPA cutoff date. Monthly pay may also be adjusted with a CPA if the job change is in progress in the Human Resources Front End (HRFE). After Payroll Calculation The department should check HRFE to verify that the job has been created. Then take the following actions: If the job has been created, and is correct, submit an approved Prior Underpayment Adjustment (PUA) in PARIS by 5 p.m. Friday for the payment to occur on the following Friday. If the job has not been created, or is not correct, contact your university’s Human Resources office to determine the status of the job. For bi-weekly employees, if the job has been created before the pay period end date and is correct, but no time was entered or approved, submit an approved PUA in PARIS by 5 p.m. Friday for the payment to occur on the following Friday. Adjustments that comply with University of Illinois System policy and are submitted by 5 p.m. Friday will be paid the following Friday. However, when a large volume of adjustments is received by the University Payroll & Benefits office, some adjustments may be processed for payment on the following week. Alterations of the adjustment schedule due to holidays will be communicated through the Payroll & Benefits Newsletter and the Business & Finance News Center . Submit an Overpayment or Pay Stop request in the Adjustment Notification Application (ANA). Pay Stops must be submitted three days before payday. See below. Reducing and Minimizing Adjustments Payroll adjustments should be avoided by maintaining good payroll practices. You can reduce the number of adjustments needed and minimize the impact on the employee and the unit by: Making sure job records are correct before payroll calculation. Maintaining unit security for those performing payroll functions. Reviewing timesheets for accuracy before approving. Meeting all deadlines posted in the Payroll Schedule . Using all methods available to correct timesheets before payroll calculation. See Payroll Correction and Adjustments job aids for more information. Applications Two applications are available for making payroll adjustment requests: the Payroll Adjustment Request Interface System (PARIS) and the Adjustment Notification Application (ANA) . PARIS ANA PARIS is the payroll adjustment entry system that interfaces with Banner, the payroll system of record. See PARIS Resources or the PARIS Resource Page for job aids and training materials. Training is required for access to the Prior Underpayment Adjustment module. Two kinds of adjustments are available in PARIS. Current Pay Adjustment (CPA) Corrects time entry errors when timesheets are in an approved status, but before the CPA deadline (usually Wednesday at 10 a.m.). Overwrites erroneous timesheet/pay data with corrected payroll information. Prior Underpayment Adjustment (PUA) Adjustment to pay an employee missed payroll. Requires training to gain access. See the PARIS Resources for job aids and training. ANA is a secured web-based application used to initiate requests for other payroll adjustments not processed in PARIS, such as: Overpayment: Requesting adjustments to correct payroll overpayments and to initiate overpayment collection. See Overpayments job aids and the Overpayments page for more information. Pay Stop: Notifying University Payroll & Benefits to stop payment to an employee after payment has been calculated but not yet distributed. Leave Balance Adjustment: Notifying Human Resources to update leave benefits for exempt and non-exempt Civil Service employees. View the Adjustment Notification Application (ANA) job aids on how to use ANA or browse the Payroll & Benefits Frequently Asked Questions page. Payroll overpayment or PUA transactions do not adjust the employee’s leave balance. Submit a leave balance adjustment transaction in ANA for each transaction which changes leave usage.

                                UPB to request a refund. Q: Why aren’t there any Federal and State taxes being deducted from my
                                    paycheck? A: You may have claimed exempt on your Federal and State withholding
                                allowance certificate. To view the current withholding allowance certificate or make
                                changes, please see My UI Info . In the My Pay section, select W-4 Form . Another possibility
                                is that you do not owe any taxes based on how you completed your Form W-4 in combination
                                with your current amount of pay. Q: I live outside Illinois and work for the university. How should I be
                                    taxed? A : The answer depends on which situation applies to your work with the
                                University of Illinois System: You live in a reciprocal state, and you travel to Illinois to perform your
                                        work a majority of the time. If you are a resident of Iowa, Kentucky,
                                    Michigan, or Wisconsin you may claim exempt from Illinois state tax withholding
                                    under the reciprocal withholding agreements between Illinois and the states
                                    indicated. Complete form IL-W-5-NR, Employee’s Statement of Nonresidence in Illinois and submit to UPB to claim the exemption. Withholdings will be directed to the state
                                    indicated on the form. To ensure proper withholding for your state, complete a
                                    withholding form if applicable. To cancel the exemption a Form IL-W-4 must be
                                    completed and submitted to UPB. You live outside of Illinois, and you perform the majority of your work
                                        outside of Illinois. First, review the policy Working Outside of
                                        Illinois - System Human Resource Services to make sure you qualify and have
                                    been approved for this work. You will need to complete the Certificate of
                                        Working Outside the State of Illinois form and submit it to UPB. To ensure

                                    Revenue Service or your tax counselor for advice. For more information about tuition waiver taxation, we recommend the course published by
                                the University Bursar's Student Money Management Center. You can register here: Taxability of
                                    Tuition Waivers - STUDENTMONEY (uillinois.edu) . Q: How will I know if my pay will be impacted by tuition taxation? A: You will be notified via email prior to the taxation taking
                                place. Q: Who could get taxed for a tuition waiver? A : Tuition waiver taxation affects graduate assistants (GA),
                                pre-professional graduate assistants (PGA), and any employees receiving tuition waivers
                                as a benefit of employment with the University of Illinois System. The first $5,250.00
                                in tuition each year is excluded from taxation according to the IRS. Individuals holding
                                a majority of their employment as a research assistant (RA) or teaching assistant (TA)
                                and meeting all IRS and University requirements are excluded from tuition waiver
                                taxation.> Q: Is the $5,250.00 exclusion applied each semester? A: No, the $5,250.00 exclusion allowed by the IRS is based on the
                                calendar year not by semester. Once an individual reaches the $5,250.00 limit
                                at any point in the year, the dollar value of all graduate level educational
                                benefits will become taxable. The taxable income will be assessed during the applicable
                                tuition waiver assessment period. Q: Will I receive a zero net paycheck because of the tax withholding
                                    method? A: It is possible for some GA/PGAs to receive pay
                                checks resulting in a net pay of zero dollars. Students who exceed the $5,250.00
                                exclusion for the year and do not have sufficient salary to cover the taxes could
                                experience a situation where no take-home pay remains. Q: Am I responsible for tax withholdings that cannot be collected in entirety
                                    from my paycheck due to a zero net check? A: When an individual does not have enough compensation to satisfy
                                the tax withholding obligations required by law, the taxes that cannot be collected in
                                entirety are in arrears. University Payroll & Benefits will track and continue to
                                pursue the collection of taxes owed on subsequent paychecks for the calendar
                                year. Q: When can I expect to see the impact of the graduated rate taxation associated
                                    with my tuition waiver? A: The assessment period of tuition waiver tax withholding is as
                                follows: Spring semester 1 st tuition waiver run: March and April Spring adjustment run: May Summer semester Tuition waiver run: July and August Fall semester 1 st tuition waiver run: October and November Fall adjustment run: December Q: If there is an adjustment to the taxable amount of my tuition waiver, when can
                                    I expect to see the correction? A: All corrections will be processed on the next regularly
                                scheduled tuition waiver assessment period. If a tuition waiver amount is removed or
                                changed, then the taxes withheld based on the initial granting of the tuition waiver
                                will be refunded on the next available tuition waiver run (see schedule above). Any
                                approved exceptions for adjustments outside the normal tuition waiver process will be
                                applied on the next regular payroll cycle. SURS and Supplemental Retirement Plans Questions Q: Who is eligible to make SURS contributions? A : In most cases, you are eligible if you work continuously for at least
                                one academic term or four months, whichever is less, and your employment is not
                                temporary, intermittent, or irregular. See the State Universities Retirement System
                                    (SURS) page for complete information on who is eligible or not eligible. Q: Who is eligible to participate in the Supplemental Retirement Plans ? A : Any employee receiving compensation from the University may make
                                traditional or Roth contributions to the 403(b) Plan if you elect to contribute a
                                minimum of $200 annually. Participation is voluntary and may be started or stopped at
                                any time (subject to payroll schedules). The Deferred Compensation 457 Plan is another
                                voluntary option for making tax-deferred or Roth contributions as a state employee. The
                                minimum contribution is $10 per pay period or 1% of your gross pay per pay period. Q: When will SURS Last Pay Information (LPI) be released? A : Upon separation, the department, UPB, and Campus HR offices will work
                                together to complete the separation processes. This includes UPB reporting the LPI on
                                the HR Front End transaction that will then be reported to SURS by HR. SURS will be
                                notified by HR as to when the Last Payroll Contribution will be posted to the SURS file.
                                Shortly after that date the employee should expect a letter from SURS. Separations Questions Q: Who is responsible for submitting Last Pay Information (LPI) to SURS? A : UPB submits the LPI to SURS. Before that can be done, the employing
                                Department is responsible for completing the following: HR Front End Separation If applicable, the PARIS PUA for a Terminal Benefits Payout (unused vacation, half
                                    of compensable sick time, and any compensable time in lieu of overtime). If applicable, the PARIS PUA for any Deferred Compensation due (for example, a
                                    9-month employee being paid over 12 months). These transactions must be routed to the payroll stop for UPB to process the payout and
                                submit the LPI. Q: When can I expect my Terminal Benefits Payouts? A : Employees with unused vacation or compensable sick time should
                                receive a Terminal Benefits payout for full vacation hours and half of the comp sick
                                hours left in their leave buckets. Any Compensable Time (in lieu of overtime) will also
                                be paid out at this time. This will be paid upon the submission of the HR Front End
                                Separation Transaction and PARIS PUA transaction. This payment will be processed after
                                the last regular pay is issued. Deceased Questions Q: What documentation is required from the deceased employee's family or
                                    beneficiary? A : In order for UPB to process the payout for a deceased employee the
                                documentation required includes: Small Estate Affidavit or copy of the last will and testament Vendor Information Form Copy of the Original Death Certificate Beneficiary's government-issued photo ID card. On the UIC Campus the information will be requested by UPB. At UIUC and UIS, Human
                                Resources will request the information from the beneficiary. Q: What happens to a deceased employee's final payroll? A : Upon notification of the employee's death, UPB will stop any payments
                                to be paid for hours worked. This payment will be processed to the estate of employee.
                                If a Terminal Benefits payout is due, UPB will wait until the required documentation,
                                the HR Front End separation transaction, and the PARIS PUA have been submitted before
                                processing the payout to the beneficiary. It is imperative that the required
                                documentation (mentioned in the previous question above) is sent to the requesting party
                                in a timely manner so that the payment can be processed to the beneficiary. Q: What happens with the taxes on a deceased employee's final payroll? A : The final payout will not have taxes such as State and Federal taken
                                since these will be paid by the estate. The beneficiary can request the employee's tax
                                forms after January 31 st by contacting UPB through the UPB Customer

                                457 Deferred Compensation will be notified after UPB receives notification that the
                                employee is deceased. The agency will contact the beneficiary on file. Insurance and Other Benefits Questions Q: What if I overpaid insurance premiums or other deductions (I need a
                                    refund)? Health, Life, Dental & Flexible Spending - If a refund is due,

                                        Portal . Customer Service staff will review the situation and verify that a
                                    deduction has been overpaid. UPB will then submit a request for a refund to CMS. If
                                    a refund is due, active employees will receive the refund through the normal payroll
                                    cycle, or the state of Illinois will mail a check to separated employees. Parking – Contact your campus Parking Office. Other Benefits – Contact UPB through the UPB Customer Service

University of Illinois System students may receive payment from the system for assistantships, awards, fellowships, grants, research support, scholarships, traineeships, travel, etc. The type, purpose, and primary beneficiary (student or University of Illinois System) of a payment determines how it is processed and whether it must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and/or the student’s university Financial Aid Office. If you are not sure which Payment Type should be used, please use the Payments to Students Selector Tool . Select the Payment Type and to expand the information and learn more. Assistantships Assistantships or payments for teaching are considered compensation for services, and are paid by University Payroll and Benefits - refer to Payroll Transaction Processing for job aids and training materials. For U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Resident Aliens for tax purposes, Assistantships are reported to the IRS and the student employee on IRS Form W-2 as wages. For Nonresident Aliens, Assistantships are reported on either IRS Form 1042-S or Form W-2 . Participant Support Cost Payments for Recruitment, Public Service, STEM Promotion, and Other Outreach Activities Introduction Some units have funds used to pay students for participating in recruitment, public service, STEM promotion, or other activities that involve participant support costs. Though not related to employment services, these payments are taxable income to the recipient. The Banner account code used to pay participant costs is generally 149110. Policy reference: 8.6.12 Participant Support Costs. IRS Reporting Participant Support Costs paid to U.S. citizen and resident alien students are reported by University Payables (UPAY) to the IRS and the recipient on Form 1099-MISC , Miscellaneous Income. Participant Support Costs paid to non-resident aliens are reported by University Payroll and Benefits (UPB) to the IRS on Form 1042-S , Foreign Person’s U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding. A Social Security Number (SSN) is required for IRS Form 1099-MISC reporting. Therefore, payment of Participant Support Costs will be suspended if no valid SSN record exists in Banner. Before submitting payment requests, units are strongly encouraged to check Banner form SPAIDEN for asterisks in the SSN field and to instruct recipients whose SSN field is blank to present documentation of their SSN to their Registrar’s Office. How to Process U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Resident Aliens for tax purposes (Resident Aliens): Payments designated as Participation Support Costs are processed via Emburse Enterprise using the Participant Cost account code, including a comprehensive description with supporting documentation. When paying participant travel, use Participant Cost Other account code or non-employee travel, as directed by the funding source. Nonresident Aliens – Please refer to Non-Wage Payments for processing information, job aids and training materials. Payments from Gift or Endowment Income Funds When making payments from gift funds (4M or 2G fund type) or university endowment income funds (4J fund type), units must be aware that the language used in donor fund agreements has varied over time. This can make interpretation of the language and restrictions as they apply to student payments difficult. The University of Illinois Foundation (UIF) has final authority in determining how UIF governing documents are interpreted. University Counsel has final authority in determining how estate gifts to the University of Illinois System are interpreted based on governing documents, such as donor will or trust. Once UIF or University Counsel has determined the true intent of the governing document(s), UIF’s or University Counsel’s interpretation must be enforced based on the definitions provided within each payment type listed on this webpage, not necessarily as worded in the governing document(s). For example, an older governing document may use the term “award”, whereas the true intent as determined by the UIF or University Counsel is a scholarship. Payments from this fund must therefore be processed as scholarships, not as awards. Payments to Non-Matriculated Students Since non-matriculated students are not yet enrolled in a degree program, the University of Illinois System has no U.S. Department of Education (ED) Title IV financial aid and no IRS Form 1098-T reporting requirements for these payments to non-matriculated students. Therefore, these payments are either: Research Experience/Opportunity payments – refer to Research Experience/Opportunity Payments within Research and Travel Payments section; or Wages for services rendered to the U of I System, in which case they are processed through University Payroll and Benefits (UPB) and reported on IRS Form W-2 – refer to Payroll Transaction Processing for job aids and training materials; or Participant Support Cost payments – refer to the Participant Support Costs webpage; or If the recipients are not expected to perform services for the U of I System: Payments to U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens for Tax Purposes are processed through Emburse Enterprise and reported as taxable income on IRS Form 1099-MISC Payments to Non-Resident Aliens – refer to Non-Wage Payments for job aids and training materials. Prizes and Awards Introduction Recipients of student prizes or awards are typically selected through a contest, drawing, or competition. Students may also be selected in recognition of charitable, scientific, educational, artistic, literary, or civic achievements. Restrictions are typically not imposed on how a student can use prizes or awards. Thus, student prizes and awards are not restricted to educational purposes. If the funding source of the student prize or award is a gift or endowment income fund, then the donor may set the criteria for recipient selection but may not select the actual recipient(s). It is important to distinguish student prizes and awards from other types of payments to ensure proper financial statement reporting and compliance with the applicable Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reporting and withholding rules. Common examples of payments that are not student prizes and awards include: Wages and other payments for employment services. These payments must be process through University Payroll and Benefits (UPB). See details at Payroll Transaction Processing . Scholarships, Fellowships and Educational Assistance Grants that are required to be used for: Educational expenses Travel which primarily benefits the student’s education Research activities that primarily benefits the student’s education Room and board See details at Scholarships, Fellowships and Educational Assistance Grants IRS Reporting Prizes and awards are reported to the IRS and the recipient on Form 1099-MISC , Miscellaneous Income, by University Payables (UPAY). A SSN is required for IRS Form 1099-MISC reporting. Therefore, payment of prizes and awards will be suspended if no valid SSN record exists in Banner. Before submitting prize and award requests, units are strongly encouraged to check Banner form SPAIDEN for asterisks in the SSN field and to instruct recipients whose SSN field is blank to present documentation of their SSN to their Registrar’s Office. Note: the IRS imposes different tax requirements for Nonresident Alien recipients of prizes and awards; for details please visit Non-Wage Payments (login required) U.S. Department of Education (ED) Compliance Prizes and awards are reported to the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) and considered a resource when determining the student's financial aid eligibility. Therefore, these payments may have an impact on the type and amount of financial aid the student is eligible to receive. OSFA will make the necessary adjustments to the student’s financial aid upon notification of the payments. These adjustments may create or increase a balance due on the student’s university account. Students are encouraged to view their Financial Aid Award letter and their billing statement periodically throughout the semester. The University of Illinois System's reporting responsibility with respect to Federal Student Aid (FSA) and any other financial assistance received by students is outlined in the FSA Administrative & Related Requirements (Chapter 3) , specifically pages 2-33, ""Coordinating Official"". How to Process U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Resident Aliens for tax purposes (Resident Aliens) Prizes and awards paid to U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Resident Alien students are disbursed to the student's university account and will be applied to any outstanding charges on the student’s account unless the student or unit emails aroperations@uillinois.edu to request the prize or award be refunded to the student. UIC and UIS Process Prize and Award payments using the Student Account Payment Request Form . UIUC Process prize and award payments through the DAWS system. Information on how to access the DAWS application is available at http://osfa.illinois.edu/resources/departmental-award-web-system-daws Nonresident Aliens Please refer to Non-Wage Payments (login required) for job aids and training materials. Financial Reporting Guidelines To ensure compliance with fund accounting and financial reporting requirements and any other applicable guidelines (such as donor intent), student prizes and awards should typically be recorded to Banner using: Account code 181700 (Student Prizes and Awards) and A program code rolling up to the 1789 (Student Prizes and Awards) NACUBO function. In addition, if the student prize or award is recorded to a Banner gift or endowment income fund, then it must comply with the donor’s intent. Gift Cards U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Resident Aliens for tax purposes (Resident Aliens) For gift cards or gift certificates presented to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and resident aliens equal to or greater than $200, the notification must be emailed to University Payables and the recipient’s campus Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA). For gift cards or gift certificates presented to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and resident aliens less than $200, the notification must be emailed to the recipient’s campus Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA). For security purposes, this information is sent using the Protected Email Attachment Application (PEAR) system. The PEAR email must include the dollar value, along with the student's name, UIN, address, and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). If unfamiliar with PEAR, consult the AITS PEAR Resource Page . Send the email to UPAY as well as the appropriate Financial Aid email listed below: UPAY1099.PearApplication.aits.uillinois.edu (University Payables) money@uic.edu (UIC OSFA) medicinefinaid@uic.edu (UIC College of Medicine OSFA) law-finaid@uic.edu (UIC Law) finaid@uis.edu (UIS OSFA) finaidscholarships@illinois.edu (UIUC OSFA) For additional information, see Tax Implications for Payments . Nonresident Aliens Gift cards or gift certificates presented to nonresident alien students are taxable, regardless of the amount. Therefore, whenever possible, process gifts to nonresident aliens as a prize or award using the Foreign National Payment e-Form , not as a gift card. If a gift card must be presented, report the gift amount on the Foreign National Payment e-Form together with the required documents for tax reporting purposes, especially the W-8BEN. Please refer to Non-Wage Payments (login required) for additional information. What to Inform Students When offering a prize or award to a student, units are strongly encouraged to provide the following information to the recipient: All prizes and awards are considered a resource when determining the student's eligibility for financial aid. Therefore, they are reported to the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA), and may have an impact on the type and amount of financial aid the student receives. OSFA will make the necessary adjustment to the student’s financial aid award upon notification of the prize or award. This adjustment may create or increase a balance due on the student’s U of I System account. The student is responsible for reviewing her/his Financial Aid Award letter and student account billing statement after the prize or award has been paid in order to understand the impact of the payment. All prizes and awards paid to U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Resident Aliens are taxable income and reported to the IRS and the student on Form 1099-MISC . A SSN is required for IRS Form 1099-MISC reporting, so payment of the prize or award will be suspended if no valid SSN record exists in Banner. Students whose SSN field in Banner is blank must present documentation of their SSN to the Office of the Registrar. All prizes and awards are disbursed to the student's university account and applied to any outstanding charges on the student’s university account unless the student or unit emails aroperations@uillinois.edu to request the prize or award be refunded to the student; the student must be enrolled in direct deposit to receive the refund. Please see sample email template to send students who are U.S. Citizens or Resident Aliens for tax purposes, when offering them a prize or award. Please see sample email template to send students who are nonesident aliens for tax purposes, when offering them a prize or award. Research and Travel Payments Introduction Many units have funds that may be used to pay student research and travel expenses. Before paying a student’s research and travel expenses, the unit must determine and document whether and why the student or the University of Illinois System is primary beneficiary of the payment. When the U of I System and the student seem to derive equal benefit, units are strongly encouraged to designate the student as primary beneficiary. Student as Primary Beneficiary Doctoral Dissertation Research Grants – The U of I System has determined that students are the primary beneficiaries of Doctoral Dissertation Research Grants such as the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DDRIG), even though the system also receives significant benefit from these grants. Research Traineeships – Research Training Grants funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), graduate research fellowships funded by the American Heart Association (AHA), and other research training grants are educational grants, so the student recipients are primary beneficiary of these payments. Trainees must fulfill the research and teaching requirements as detailed by the grantors, but trainees do not perform services as student or system employees. Scholarship/Fellowship Funds – When the source of research or travel payments is a fund designated for scholarships or fellowships, the student is primary beneficiary. U of I System as Primary Beneficiary Example A: A student is asked to travel to a conference held in San Francisco to present a paper on behalf of a U of I System's department. Example B: A student travels to Germany to perform research for the U of I System, which happens to be the same topic related to student B’s dissertation. The U of I System would perform research on this topic regardless of student B’s dissertation topic. Example C: A student is asked to travel to New York City to represent the U of I System in a Scholastic Bowl competition (in this example, the student is not required to be employed by the unit paying for the travel). Example D: A student submits a travel proposal in which the U of I System’s business purpose is effectively described, receives departmental approval that requires a clearly stated deliverable upon the student’s return, and the student presents that deliverable to the department’s satisfaction. Example E: A student is asked to attend a conference or training that will enhance their knowledge and skills to effectively perform their university employment duties (e.g. student Orientation Leader). Research Experience/Opportunity Payments Fellowships, scholarships, or grants paid directly to students for research experience programs are processed as fellowships as the student is the primary beneficiary. See Scholarships, Fellowships and Educational Assistance Grants for information on how to process. Example programs include: Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP) Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow (SURF) Summer Pre-Doctoral Institute (SPI) Research Experience and Mentoring (REM) Undergraduate Research and Mentoring (URM) Payments made on behalf of students for travel, research, and related expenses who participate in these programs are processed through Emburse Enterprise as the U of I System is primary beneficiary of travel and research related payments. For fellowship payments to research experience/opportunity participants who are enrolled in the U of I System during the semester in which payment is made, the program code should roll up to NACUBO function 1788 (“Fellowships”). For fellowship payments to research experience/opportunity participants who are not enrolled in the U of I System during the semester in which payment is made, the program code should roll up to either NACUBO function 1100 (“Research”) when participants are engaged in official U of I System research activity, or to NACUBO function 1000 (“Instruction”) when participants are engaged in simulated research activity. How to Process Research Experience/Opportunity UIUC – When paying UIUC students directly for participating in programs such as Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) , Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP) , Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow (SURF) , Summer Pre-Doctoral Institute (SPI) , Research Experience and Mentoring (REM) , Undergraduate Research and Mentoring, etc.): Download the payment form , complete and upload it on the Graduate College REU Programs webpage to process a Research Experience/Opportunity fellowship payment; Units are strongly encouraged to include amounts for living expenses and travel in the fellowship paid directly to the student; however, when this is not feasible, payment must be processed via Emburse Enterprise including a clear and comprehensive description with supporting documentation of the U of I System business purpose and benefit. Student as Primary Beneficiary U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Resident Aliens for tax purposes (Resident Aliens): When paying U.S. Citizen and Resident Alien students for research and travel expenses that primarily benefit the student, these payments must be paid as a scholarship, fellowship or grant (see Scholarships, Fellowships and Educational Assistance Grants). The only exceptions to this rule are: Research expenses for human subject payments Wages paid to student workers Purchases of the U of I System property or equipment that retains functional value after the student’s research is complete and remains in the U of I System’s possession Payments for these exceptions are submitted through Emburse Enterprise , iBuy, or University Payroll and Benefits (UPB) for student worker wages. When paying U.S. Citizen and Resident Alien students for research and travel expenses that primarily benefit the student, units must be aware of the following requirements: When making research and travel payments from sponsored research funds, receipts documenting the full amount of the expenses must be forwarded to Sponsored Programs Administration (SPA) Post-Award for UIUC students, or Grants & Contracts (GCO) for UIC and UIS students; sponsor funded travel and research expense payments may be delayed or reversed until or unless SPA Post-Award or GCO receives all necessary receipts. Research and travel expenses are not generally part of the student’s standard Cost of Attendance (COA) as established by OSFA in accordance with U.S. Department of Education (ED) guidelines; therefore, to minimize the risk of a travel or research scholarship or fellowship reducing the student’s eligibility for other financial aid, the unit must notify OSFA that the scholarship or fellowship is for travel or research expenses that exceed COA, and provide OSFA with a description of the expenses being covered by the scholarship or fellowship. Research and travel scholarships or fellowships are disbursed to the student's university account and will be applied to any outstanding balance on the student’s account unless he student or unit emails aroperations@uillinois.edu to request the scholarship or fellowship be refunded by direct deposited into the student’s bank account to pay the student’s travel or research expenses. Upon notifying students of scholarships and fellowships, units should inform the students that the scholarship or fellowship will be disbursed to the student’s university account, that it may impact the student’s other financial aid, and that the U of I System will report it to the IRS on Form 1098-T. If the unit requests aroperations@uillinois.edu to refund any scholarships or fellowships to students, the unit must also inform those students that they may still owe an outstanding balance on their student account which must be paid by the due date to prevent a financial hold of registration and transcripts. Nonresident Aliens When paying Nonresident Alien students for research and travel expenses that primarily benefit the student, please refer to Non-Wage Payments (login required) for job aids and training materials. U of I System as Primary Beneficiary When paying students for research and travel expenses that primarily benefit the U of I System, payments must be processed via Emburse Enterprise including a clear and comprehensive description with supporting documentation of the U of I System business purpose and benefit. Research and travel payments that primarily benefit the U of I System are not reportable to the IRS as taxable income. All U of I System policies and procedures apply to these payments, including the requirement that payment or reimbursement requests be entered in Emburse Enterprise within 60 days of the date the expenditure was incurred, to avoid being reported to the IRS as taxable income. The unit is responsible for documenting why the U of I System is primary beneficiary, and retaining this documentation for audit purposes. Scholarships, Fellowships, and Educational Assistance Grants Introduction As defined in IRS Publication 970 Tax Benefits for Education , scholarships, fellowships, educational assistance, and research grants are amounts paid to, or for the benefit of a student (whether an undergraduate, graduate, or professional student) at an educational institution to aid in the pursuit of their studies or related research. These payments typically support educational needs, such as tuition, fees, room, board, supplies, and travel where the primary purpose of the payment is to benefit the student’s education, academic development, or research. No past, present or future services that further the University of Illinois System’s mission are expected from the student in return for these payments, nor are students expected to repay the System for these scholarships, fellowships, educational assistance, and research grants. Scholarships, fellowships and educational assistance grants designated for qualified expenses (i.e., tuition and mandatory fees, books, or supplies) are not taxable income to the recipient. However, scholarship, fellowship and grant payments for unqualified expenses (e.g., room, board, travel, research, non-mandatory fees, books or supplies) are taxable income to the recipient. It is the student’s responsibility to determine and report to the IRS taxable scholarships, fellowships and/or grants received. Scholarship and grant recipients may be undergraduate, graduate or professional program students; fellowships are typically paid to graduate students, though there are exceptions (e.g., see Research Experience/Opportunity funds in the Research and Travel Payments section). If the scholarship, fellowship or educational assistance grant is funded by a gift, the donor may set the criteria for recipient selection but may not select the actual recipient(s). For scholarships , the Banner account code generally used is 181100, and the program code should generally roll up to NACUBO function 1787. For fellowships , the Banner account code used for educational expenses is 181300, the Banner account code used to pay living expenses is 281300, and the program code should generally roll up to NACUBO function 1788. IRS Reporting All scholarships, fellowships and grants paid to U.S. Citizen and Resident Alien students are reported to the IRS and the recipient on Form 1098-T , Tuition Statement, by University Bursar. A Social Security Number (SSN) is required for IRS Form 1098-T reporting. See IRS Publication 970 Tax Benefits For Education for additional information regarding taxability of these payments. Scholarships, fellowships and grants paid to Nonresident Alien students are not reported on Form 1098-T unless the student requests University Bursar to do so. However, with the exception of qualified scholarships, qualified fellowships, and W-2 reportable wages, all payments to Nonresident Alien students are reported to the IRS and the recipient on Form 1042-S , Foreign Person’s U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding, by University Payroll and Benefits (UPB). Withholding may be required on these payments. For additional information, see Payments to Foreign Nationals . U.S. Department of Education (ED) Compliance All scholarships, fellowships and grants are reported to the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) and considered a resource when determining the student's financial aid eligibility. Therefore, these payments may have an impact on the type and amount of financial aid the student is eligible to receive. OSFA will make the necessary adjustments to the student’s financial aid upon notification of the payments. These adjustments may create or increase a balance due on the student’s university account. Students are encouraged to view their Financial Aid Award letter and their billing statement periodically throughout the semester. The university’s reporting responsibility with respect to Federal Student Aid (FSA) and any other financial assistance received by students is outlined in the FSA Administrative & Related Requirements (Chapter 3) , specifically page 2-33, ""Coordinating Official"". How to process Preliminary notes regarding scholarships, fellowships and grants designated for student travel, research or emergency expenses: When paying scholarships or fellowships from sponsored research funds, units must forward to Sponsored Programs Administration (SPA) Post-Award for UIUC students, or Grants & Contracts (GCO) for UIC and UIS students; sponsor funded travel and research expense payments may be delayed or reversed until or unless SPA Post-Award or GCO receives all necessary receipts. Because travel, research or emergency expenses are generally not part of the student’s standard Cost of Attendance (COA) as established by OSFA in accordance with ED guidelines, units must notify OSFA that the scholarship, fellowship or grant is for travel, research or emergency expenses that exceed COA, and provide a description of the expenses being covered by the scholarship, fellowship or grant. This will minimize the risk of the scholarship, fellowship or grant reducing other financial aid the student received. Because scholarships, fellowships or grants designated for travel, research or emergency expenses are disbursed to the student's university account, they will be applied to any outstanding charges on the student’s university account unless the student or unit emails aroperations@uillinois.edu to request the disbursement be refunded to pay the student’s travel, research or emergency expenses. U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Resident Aliens for tax purposes (Resident Aliens): UIC and UIS Process non-recurring scholarships and fellowships for educational expenses payments (i.e. payments to less than 10 students that are tied to a C-FOAP that is valid for only one academic year) using the Student Account Payment Request Form Process non-recurring scholarships and fellowships for educational expenses payments to 10 or more students through the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) Process recurring scholarships and fellowships for educational expenses payments (i.e. payments tied to a C-FOAP that will remain the same year after year) through OSFA Process fellowships for living expenses through the Graduate College (UIC) or Graduate Studies Office (UIS); payment will be issued by University Payroll and Benefits (UPB) Process travel payment scholarships through OSFA; include an email to the applicable address below, noting that the scholarship is for travel expenses that exceed standard Cost of Attendance (COA) as established by OSFA in accordance with ED guidelines, and provide a description of the expenses covered by the travel scholarship.

What to Inform Students When offering a scholarship, fellowship or grant to a student, units are strongly encouraged to provide the following information to the recipient: All scholarships, fellowships and grants are considered a resource when determining the student's eligibility for financial aid. Therefore, they are reported to the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA), and may have an impact on the type and amount of financial aid the student receives. OSFA will make the necessary adjustment to the student’s financial aid award upon notification of the scholarship, fellowship or grant. This adjustment may create or increase a balance due on the student’s university account. The student is responsible for reviewing her/his Financial Aid Award letter and student account billing statement after the scholarship, fellowship or grant has been paid in order to understand the impact of the payment. All scholarships, fellowships and grants paid to U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Resident Aliens will be reported to the student and the IRS on Form 1098-T for the calendar year in which the payment was made. The University of Illinois System does not report Form 1098-T for Nonresident Aliens unless requested. Scholarships, fellowships and grants for unqualified expenses, i.e. room, board, travel, research, non-mandatory fees, books or supplies, are taxable income (refer student to IRS Publication 970 ). It is the student’s responsibility to determine and report to the IRS taxable scholarships, fellowships and/or grants received. When scholarships, fellowships or grants designated for travel, research or emergency expenses are disbursed to the student’s university account, they may be direct deposited to the student’s bank account if the student is enrolled in direct deposit and the student or unit emails aroperations@uillinois.edu to request disbursement be refunded to pay the student’s travel, research or emergency expenses. Please see sample email template to send to students who are U.S. Citizens or Resident Aliens for tax purposes, when offering them a scholarship, fellowship or grant. Please see sample email template to send to students who are nonresident aliens for tax purposes, when offering them a scholarship, fellowship or grant. Tangible Items Introduction Purchasing tangible items for students (e.g., laptops, computers, iPads, tablets, research equipment, etc.) with value of $200 or more is not allowed due to the complex tax, property accounting, and financial aid implications that may occur. Units that wish to use available resources to provide funding for the student to purchase tangible items over $200 must do so in the form of a Prize and Award or Scholarship paid directly to the student account. Refer to the corresponding section on this page for instructions on how to process these payments. Purchasing tangible items for students (e.g., laptops, computers, iPads, tablets, research equipment, etc.) with a value of less than $200 is allowable up to unit discretion. To ensure proper classification for financial and tax reporting purposes, these types of purchases need to be classified as either a Prize and Award (181700 expense account code, 1789 NACUBO function) or a Scholarship (181100 expense account code, 1787 NACUBO function). IRS Reporting If the purchase is classified as a Prize and Award, and the student receives a cumulative value of $600 or more during the calendar year, the Prize and award will be reported to the IRS and the recipient on Form 1099-MISC , Miscellaneous Income, by University Payables (UPAY). A SSN is required for IRS Form 1099-MISC reporting. Therefore, payment of prizes and awards will be suspended if no valid SSN record exists in Banner. Before submitting prize and award requests, units are strongly encouraged to check Banner form SPAIDEN for asterisks in the SSN field and to instruct recipients whose SSN field is blank to present documentation of their SSN to their Registrar’s Office. Note: the IRS imposes different tax requirements for Nonresident Alien recipients of prizes and awards; for details please visit Award, Prize and Human Subject Payments. If the purchase is classified as a scholarship, the scholarship will be reported to the IRS and the recipient on Form 1098-T , Tuition Statement, by University Bursar. A Social Security Number (SSN) is required for IRS Form 1098-T reporting. See IRS Publication 970 Tax Benefits For Education for additional information regarding taxability of these payments. Prior to submitting reimbursement for these purchases in Emburse Enterprise, please contact UI Payment Compliance with detailed information so the appropriate reporting can be completed.

Employees are not in travel status during their normal daily commute to and from work. Travel Status Begins When employees leave headquarters, their residence, or other authorized locations to go directly to their destination. Travel Status Ends When employees return directly to headquarters, their residence, or other authorized locations after completing system business. Headquarters Official headquarters is where employees perform most of their duties, usually the area within the city limits. However, headquarters for employees at the University of Illinois Chicago is defined as the campus area. An employee's residence may be considered their official headquarters if their assigned duties require non-commuting travel every working day. Commuting The round-trip mileage between the employee's residence and headquarters. This is not a reimbursable expense. Travel Mileage Travel mileage begins at an employee’s residence or headquarters depending on which one is closer to their destination. For example, John and Mary below traveled to the same destination. John's travel mileage began and ended at headquarters because he would have had to go to and from work that day even if he were not traveling. Mary's travel mileage began and ended at her house because it is closer to her destination than headquarters.

Employees must seek the most economical fare when making commercial airline reservations. To obtain the best fares, airline tickets should be purchased as soon as department authorization is received, preferably a minimum of three weeks prior to departure. Purchase of Airline Tickets with TCard The preferred method for purchasing airline tickets is with a TCard. TCards can be used to purchase airfare through a Contracted Travel Agency or through any air travel provider that offers the most economical price, including non-contracted travel agencies, online booking tools, or airline direct websites. The traveler is responsible for retaining receipts or itineraries required to process an expense report. Cancelled Travel and Unused Airline Tickets 1. Contact the airline carrier or travel agent who booked the ticket prior to departure to cancel your reservation(s). All airline reservations must be canceled prior to departure, or the entire ticket amount may be forfeited. Non-refundable main cabin tickets Travelers have up to a year from the ticket issuance date to apply the value of the unused ticket to another flight. Frequent travelers with airline status may be able to get a refund so be sure to ask. If the travel was booked through a travel agent and the unused ticket will not be used by the traveler it was issued to, ask the booking agent if an airline voucher can be issued to the University of Illinois for the unused ticket amount. Basic Economy tickets Due to the following restrictions, a Basic Economy ticket may not be the most cost-effective option, especially for non-employee travel. Cannot be changed or cancelled Cannot be transferred to another traveler or airline voucher Checking a bag may not be allowed or allowed at an additional cost Carry-ons may be restricted Advance seat selection may not be allowed or allowed at an additional cost Refundable tickets Refunds are made to the original form of payment used to purchase them. 2. Keep all receipts and documentation University Payables will process properly documented expenses incurred due to cancelled travel if the cancellation is beyond the control of the traveler. 3. Create an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of all cancelled and unused airline tickets If a canceled ticket cannot be refunded or vouchered in the name of the university (see above), the airline will carry the credit in the name of the traveler. It’s suggested that units maintain some record (e.g., spreadsheet) of these situations so that the credit can be subsequently used for university business travel. NOTE: If the airline ticket was purchased in the iTravel Online Booking Tool or through the system’s contracted agency and cancelled prior to flight departure, the airline ticket will automatically save to the employee’s iTravel profile and may be applied as a credit toward future business travel. Purchase of Tickets with Personal Funds While a TCard is the preferred method of purchasing tickets for air transportation, employees may also purchase tickets for approved university travel using their own personal funds. If this method is used, employees are reimbursed for the ticket purchase on an expense report submitted at the completion of the trip. Appropriate receipts and approvals are required. See Section 15 - Travel for more information. Internal Control of Tickets Purchased with TCard or Other Means The unit is responsible for ensuring that any airline tickets purchased in advance with system funds, via a TCard or other means, are utilized for appropriate university business travel. The unit is also responsible for documenting such use in their unit's files. 14 Hour Air Travel Rule The State of Illinois now allows university travelers, with unit approval, to purchase business class airfare when the scheduled flight time, including stopovers and plane changes, exceeds 14 hours. Other university policies are still applicable. Business class flights that do not meet the 14-hour criteria must have an approved accommodation in place prior to incurring the expense. Preferred Seating Since all travel must have unit approval prior to booking, University Payables no longer requires an approved exception for seat selection fees. Preferred seating is now a standard air travel expense. Private Aircraft The University of Illinois System does not cover any employee's legal responsibility or their liability when using personal planes, even if such use is for system business. The maximum reimbursement for private plane transportation is limited to the lowest available commercial round-trip air fare, including the cost of transportation to and from the airport. Reimbursement covers operating expenses of a private plane at the rate of $1.50 per air mile.

Effective February 1, 2024, the State of Illinois has adopted the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) lodging rates . Before making a reservation, check the GSA site to be sure the cost meets these requirements. For additional information about University of Illinois System policies on lodging and travel, see Business and Financial Policies and Procedures Manual, 15 Travel . Employees and guests must present a personal credit card at check-in to pay for any personal charges they might incur. Personal charges are not allowed on the TCard. Hotel Discount Programs The system offers employees several ways to obtain discounted hotel rates. This page provides detailed information on these offers. Lodging Rental Brokers Use of a lodging rental broker (e.g., Airbnb, Tripping, Home Away) is allowed as a travel expense if the daily rate does not exceed the University of Illinois System’s Lodging Allowance Rates. Rent and damage deposits may initially be made with the TCard. However, departments must manage the credit of damage deposits back to the TCard. Damage charges are personal expenses and must be paid by the traveler, using non-system funds. Damage deposits will not be reimbursed if personal funds are used to secure the lodging. Use of a property through a lodging rental broker known to be owned by a system employee or his/her immediate family member is prohibited. Group Sales Agreements Group Sales Agreements must be attached to a requisition and submitted to Purchasing for processing. The Purchasing Division has the authority to facilitate the purchase of equipment, materials, commodities, supplies, and services. No other individual or university department has the authority to commit the system to purchasing goods and services, unless that authority has been specifically delegated to them. For more information, visit the Purchases section of the Business and Finance website. Travel Card (TCard) Guidelines A travel agency will “guarantee only” a hotel room for university employees and guests. Employees and guests must present a personal credit card at check-in to pay for any personal charges they might incur. Personal charges are not allowed on a TCard. If a Travel Arranger’s TCard is to be used for payment of the hotel room and tax, the Travel Arranger must contact the hotel directly, prior to guest check-in, to make these arrangements. The hotel will send the Travel Arranger a third-party billing form to be completed, signed, and returned to the hotel. This is the only way the hotel will know to get a credit card at check-in for any additional hotel charges that might be incurred. Otherwise, all charges will go on the Travel Arranger’s TCard, which could result in an out of compliance issue. A travel agency should not get involved with or sign the third-party billing form. University of Illinois Lodging with Conference Facilities UIUC UIC UIS Allerton Park & Retreat Center Illini Union Hotel Alice Campbell Alumni Center Conference Center at the I-Hotel UIC Meetings & Conference Information UIC Forum Illini Center The UIS Conference Center Lodging FAQs How do I guarantee my lodging reservation? Your university T-Card or personal credit card guarantees your lodging reservation. When making your reservation, always request the state/government rate and confirm that it is the lowest rate available. What are the procedures for canceling a lodging reservation? When making a reservation, ask about the cancellation policy. If you book your lodging through one of the contracted travel agencies, contact that agency to process your cancellation. If you must cancel a reservation, do so before the deadline. The system is not responsible for charges incurred due to late cancellations. What are the procedures for lodging reimbursement? Obtain the original hotel billing receipt to attach to the Expense Report. Carefully review the bill to ensure that the room charge reflects the authorized rate and that no unauthorized charges have been added.

To secure a room at or below the state rate, make the reservation as far in advance as possible. If the state rate is not available on a hotel's booking website, call the hotel and identify yourself as a University of Illinois System employee and request the state rate. Some of the hotels listed on the CMS website will not make a reservation at the state allowable lodging rate. They will only honor this rate after the employee presents their university i-Card at check-in, thereby proving their status as a state of Illinois employee National Hotel Chains Many national hotel chains extend discounted rates to government employees. Links to hotel chain websites and toll-free phone numbers are provided. Individual hotels determine if they will offer a government rate and what their requirements are to qualify for it.

All equipment must be recorded in the FABweb system, including Capital Development Board equipment. You do not have to include items in your departmental inventory in the following circumstances: Your storeroom unit acquires equipment for resale. Your unit has purchased items for the use of a non-university entity. Coding equipment and property, using the correct account code, is important because these codes affect many activities in the life cycle of the equipment. If account codes are incorrect, processing a new acquisition in FABweb, conducting biennial inventory for your unit, or responding to auditor questions will be difficult. Equipment Coding Equipment Tags - Numbers & Labels Equipment Threshold Change Purchased Equipment If your unit purchased equipment through the requisition/purchase order process using a PCard, a standing order, direct pay, an equipment account code, or an initial record, an Original Tag (OTag) will be created in FABweb for you to complete. For an explanation of how equipment purchases are entered into FABweb, consult Equipment-Banner Tags Process Flow . For information about processing purchased equipment, consult the Business and Financial Policies and Procedures Manual, 12.1.5 Process a New Acquisition in FABweb . Determining the Value of Equipment To value equipment, the initial purchase price of the equipment, along with all ancillary charges necessary to place the equipment into its intended location and condition it for use, need to be included in the final cost. These costs include things like shipping, installation, transit insurance, testing, professional fees, site preparation costs, trade-in-allowance, and training if it is required for initial use of the equipment. If any of these charges are on an invoice with multiple items, use the prorated amount based on the total invoice amount, adding the appropriate expenses to the related equipment and non-equipment expenses. Some ancillary charges such as installation may be charged to some equipment and not to others and excluded from supplies or consumables. Do not include finance charges, AppleCare, warranty expenses, or maintenance contracts in the cost valuation of the equipment as these items should be individually expensed to an appropriate non-equipment account code. Also refer to 12.1.3 Determine the Value of Equipment or Property . Non-Cash Additions A non-cash addition is a term used to describe adding equipment to Banner inventory that has a fair market value of $2500 or greater and is not acquired in exchange for cash. Since there is no invoice payment, no Otag is created in the normal purchasing process, and the equipment will not automatically appear in the unit’s FABweb new acquisitions. Therefore, you must request this addition to inventory using a link in FABweb. Property Accounting will manually add the non-cash addition to Banner inventory. Common examples of non-cash additions include: Found Equipment : Equipment that is discovered within the unit and has no apparent PO or invoice. At the time of finding the equipment, it has a fair market value at or above the inventory threshold of $2,500. Donated (gifts) : Gifts of equipment to a unit must be reported to the U of I Foundation. These donations must be added to inventory if the fair market value is at or over the inventory threshold of $2,500. Loaned Equipment : Equipment received on loan from an institution outside of the University may be considered a non-cash addition if it is at or over the inventory threshold of $2,500 and will be on campus in excess of one semester. The correct “Title-To” code must be on the equipment if not owned by the State of Illinois. Contact Property Accounting for assistance. Transfer to the U of I System with Researcher : Equipment transferring from another university with faculty member or researcher is considered a non-cash addition and must be entered in FABweb if the fair market value of the equipment is at or over the inventory threshold of $2,500. Contact Property Accounting for assistance. For additional information about all non-cash additions consult policies 12.1.7 Identify Donated, Found, and Other Non-Cash Addition Equipment and 12.1.8 12.1.8 Add Donated, Found, and Other Non-Cash Addition Equipment to FABweb . Equipment Transferred from University Surplus If your unit has received equipment from the surplus warehouse, you will receive a notification email that the transfer has been completed. If the equipment obtained from the Surplus Warehouse is at or above the inventory threshold of $2,500, the tracked equipment has already been transferred to your unit equipment inventory. You must update the attributes for that inventoried item in FABweb. Important attributes for this type of update include updating location, custodian, equipment manager, and condition code. If the equipment has an Entity code associated with it, this will either need to be updated or removed. For additional information, consult policy 12.2.4 Maintain Entity Codes for Self-Supporting Activities . Transfer of Equipment within the U of I System To learn how to completes transfers of equipment from one unit to another in FABweb, please consult the following resources: Policy 12.3.1 Transfer Equipment to Another Unit FABweb Transfers and Disposals Lesson 1 Title Transfer from Sponsor Equipment purchased with certain sponsored project funds (grants, contracts, gifts, or federal appropriations) may be titled to or owned by the sponsoring agency and the University of Illinois System is the temporary custodian of that equipment used for research purposes.

If equipment codes are incorrect, you may have difficulties processing a new acquisition in FABweb, conducting the biennial inventory for your unit, or responding to auditors' questions. Equipment Account Codes When purchasing equipment, it is critical that you use the correct equipment account code. Not only do account codes categorize equipment by cost and type, but equipment account codes generate the Otag record in Banner. To correctly value equipment, any costs associated with getting the new equipment to campus and getting it operational should be considered in the final cost of the new equipment. This would include installation costs, freight, transit insurance, initial inspection, trade-in credits, testing, and training. These costs need to be account coded in the overall cost of the purchase to an equipment account code 127* or 163*. Trade-In of old equipment: For any trade-in of like-kind equipment, consider the vendor trade-in allowance that will be added to the value of the equipment to select the correct account code. Training for new equipment: If the training included on the invoice is not required to put the equipment into service, it should not be added to the original cost of the equipment and coded to a 147-account code. Training expenses for end users that is not required for initial use of the equipment should not be included in the cost of the equipment. Do not include finance charges, AppleCare, warranty expenses, or maintenance contracts in the cost valuation of the equipment as these items should be individually expensed to an appropriate non-equipment account code. If an incorrect account code is used, Banner will not create an Otag record, and the new acquisition will not show up in the unit’s FABweb inbox. Below are the equipment account code ranges that will generate an Otag: Otag Code Range Note 127* $2,500 - $4,999.99 controlled but not capitalized equipment 163* $5,000 and greater controlled and capitalized equipment. Account codes starting with 121, 122, 124 and 126 do not generate Otag records. If an incorrect account code is assigned to an item, it can affect the reconciling of your unit's monthly operating ledger, as well as your biennial inventory. To correct account codes, process a journal voucher in Banner. If you have questions about equipment account codes, contact University Property Accounting and Reporting (UPAR). Types of Codes Account Code An account code categorizes equipment by cost and type. If you do not enter an equipment account code when an item is purchased, there will be no skeletal record in FABweb and Banner Fixed Assets. In addition, equipment without a code will not be capitalized correctly. Capitalizing equipment is an important part of our total financial picture. You must submit a Journal Voucher form to correct an incorrect account code. Commodity Code Categorizes equipment for reporting purposes; used to assign a useful life to an item for depreciation. If an item's commodity code is incorrect, that item will not be classified or depreciated correctly. Location Code Identifies the university, building, and room where a piece of equipment can be found. If even the room information is missing or incorrect it will adversely affect the Facilities and Administrative (F & A) rate, the overhead we charge to all grants for using our facilities. In addition, your biennial inventory will be more difficult to complete because you will not know where to look for the item. Condition Code Indicates the use status of a fixed asset, such as whether it is being used by the unit or is on loan to an employee. If an item's condition code is incorrect, it will adversely affect the Facilities and Administrative (F & A) rate, the overhead we charge to all grants for using our facilities. Entity Code Identifies the type of self-supporting activity, or ""entity"" for which a piece of equipment is currently used. If an entity code is incorrect, you will have to submit an Entity Code Change Request form to correct it. Importance of Capitalizing Capitalization means to classify the cost of an item as a long-term investment because that item will be used over a period of time. Therefore, that item's cost is not charged against the earnings of one fiscal year as part of the cost of day-to-day operations. Instead, it is charged over several fiscal years. Because the item is worth less in each succeeding fiscal year, the amount that is charged each year is depreciated. Depreciation reflects the reduction in the value of the item due to obsolescence and wear and tear. University Property Accounting and Reporting calculates capitalization and depreciation for you each year, so you do not have to perform that function. Accurate capitalization and depreciation are important because they are part of maintaining accurate records about U of I System equipment and property. The system maintains accurate property records because: It's system policy and state law (Illinois Property Control Act). It's required under the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Equipment records are part of the system overhead which is used in calculating the Facilities and Administrative (F & A) rate, the indirect cost we charge sponsored projects. If our calculation is wrong, it could cost the system money. Property records are part of University financial statements which affect our ability to raise money because the statements are used to calculate our credit score which in turn affects our bond rating. By following consistent accounting principles from GASB and FASB, it is possible to perform financial analysis comparing one unit to another and our University of Illinois System to other universities. It helps us determine our general financial health. If your unit remodels, renovates, or performs maintenance that is over $250,000, the cost may be subject to capitalization. Consult Capitalized Construction Projects . If your unit purchases or develops an intangible asset, the cost may be subject to capitalization. Consult with University Property Accounting for the correct account code. Policy 12 Property Accounting Definitions 12.1.3 Determining the Value of Equipment or Property 12.1.4 Enter Account Codes when Purchasing Equipment 12.2 Maintain Equipment Records - Avoiding Property Accounting Problems Related Application Account Code Search Related Links Equipment Account Codes - Quick Reference FAQs Q. What is the difference between commodity codes and account codes? A. Account Codes indicate the type of expense category for equipment purchased and indicates whether equipment is expensed or capitalized or is not equipment. Equipment account codes are a part of the CFOAPAL: 127nn equipment with cost from $2,500 to $4,999.99 163nn equipment with cost of $5,000 and above Commodity Codes classify the type of equipment purchased. Departments must take extreme care in assigning the correct commodity code for a newly acquired asset because the commodity code determines the useful life of the asset, which directly affects the annual calculation of depreciation. Q. Where do I find the list of location codes? A. The list of location codes can be found on the OBFS Equipment Management website on the right-hand side under Helpful Documents.

These items also require affixing of the University PTag label to identify it as a unique tracked item for easy identification by unit staff and external auditors. In Banner Fixed Asset equipment is identified by two tags. OTag (Origination Tag) refers to the asset reference number initially assigned to the item record when created in Banner. PTag (Permanent Tag/physical label) refers to the physical label affixed to the equipment. OTag (Origination Tag/Reference Number) When an invoice using an appropriate equipment account code is paid, Banner automatically creates a skeletal equipment record in FABweb and assigns the OTag number. An OTag number exists only as a reference number in Banner and is not on a physical label. An OTag is a 9-digit number beginning with T for assets created directly in Banner on or after July 1, 2003. Assets that were acquired before July 1, 2003, are known as legacy assets. The records for these legacy assets were converted into Banner records at the time of Banner implementation and were assigned 9-digit OTag numbers beginning with O. Examples: O00000080 - OTag number of a legacy asset T00006786 - OTag number automatically generated by Banner PTag (Permanent Tag/Physical Label) To maintain uniformity, labels that have property control (PTag) numbers on them are distributed by University Property Accounting and Reporting (UPAR). For identification and control purposes, all equipment under the jurisdiction of the University of Illinois System must be assigned a property control (PTag) number that must be affixed to the equipment. Units must affix labels in accordance with the process in Business and Financial Policies and Procedures Manual, 12.1.6 Affix Property Labels . The full PTag number must be used when updating asset information in FABweb or preparing transfer or disposal forms. For specific information about dollar thresholds, consult the Business and Financial Policies and Procedures Manual, 12.1.6 Affix Property Labels , and 12.1.9 Determine Capitalization Thresholds . PTag numbers are 9 digits long. The format of the PTag number is constructed as follows: Digit 1 = ""P"" for new acquisitions, ""L"" (from ""legacy"") for converted records, or ""S"" for converted records with multiple components Digits 2-3 = Campus location: 10-Urbana, 20-Chicago, 22-DSCC, 24-Peoria, 26-Rockford, 40-Springfield Digits 4-9 = A sequential number to distinguish the specific asset Units are responsible for the internal controls outlined in the Business and Financial Policies and Procedures Manual, 12.2.3 Comply with Unit Head Property Custodial Responsibilities . Reference Number Assignment Because the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Administrative Code, Section 5010.400 mandates that property records be adjusted within 30 days of acquisition, change, or deletion of equipment items, all steps in the process of equipment acquisition and Banner record creation must be done promptly and accurately. Request Replacement PTags If your unit identifies equipment assigned a PTag in Banner, but no physical tag is affixed, you may request a replacement PTag by sending an email to the equipment processor assigned to your unit's org. The PTag will be printed by our office and sent to you via campus mail. Red & White ""State of Illinois, University of Illinois"" Stickers Equipment with a cost of $100 to $2499.99 must have a red and white State of Illinois, University of Illinois sticker placed on it. This equipment is not tracked in Banner inventory but is still identified as property owned by the State of Illinois.

The only exceptions are vehicles and firearms which are inventoried regardless of cost. The State is providing this legislative relief to reduce the volume of tracked equipment at the University and other State Agencies so they can focus on higher value equipment. Two Phase Implementation Plan In order to implement the threshold change in an orderly manner, the University will use a two phase implementation plan as follows: Phase 1 – New acquisitions threshold (April 1, 2023) Phase 2 – “Dispose” standalone and non-capitalized records that have depreciated below the $2,500 threshold (April 13, 2023) Phase 1 - New Acquisitions Effective April 1, 2023 University units must use the new $2,500 threshold when account coding equipment purchases and when evaluating items to be added to inventory in FY23 and beyond. Banner equipment account code titles have been updated for the new threshold and these ranges should be used on all purchases moving forward. Units will continue to use the 127* and 163* range of account codes for purchasing equipment and for generating and completing equipment new acquisition records through FABweb. Phase 2 - ""Disposal"" Standalone and Non-cap Depreciated Records < $2,500 The University FABweb and Biennial Inventory applications will be unavailable April 13, 2023 to complete the bulk ""disposal"" of standalone equipment records less than $2,500 from Banner. A disposal code is added to the equipment record to remove the item for biennial inventory purpose. Equipment listings of item records disposed will be sent to FABweb Unit Reps and Biennial Unit Contacts in April. For the items removed from inventory, units must replace the Ptag with the unnumbered label identifying “Property of State of Illinois – University of Illinois.” Units are required to retag equipment by their next scheduled Biennial Inventory cycle and inventory certification date. The state law and regulations allow the University and state agencies to request removal of items with an acquisition cost of $2,500 and above that have depreciated below $2,500. The University will continue to inventory and retain all capitalized equipment records ($5,000 and above) until items are disposed, consistent with the historical treatment of capitalized items. Maintaining these capitalized records is required for financial reporting and Federal grants. The University received pre-approval from CMS to remove the non-capitalized items from inventory that have depreciated below $2,500. Property Accounting analyzed all non-capitalized equipment and estimated the current Net Book Value based on a quasi-depreciation calculation. See section below titled “Quasi-Depreciation Calculation” for more information on how we determined the depreciated value of each item. For items removed from inventory, units must replace the Ptag with the unnumbered label identifying ""Property of State of Illinois – University of Illinois."" Units are required to retag equipment by their next scheduled Biennial Inventory cycle and inventory certification date. The Unnumbered labels/stickers are to be purchased from iStores. UIUC units can place an order for labels/stickers either directly from iStores or by using the iStores catalog on iBuy Shopping Showcase. UIC and UIS units can place an order for the labels/stickers by using the iStores catalog in iBuy Shopping Showcase. In iStores, search for ""U OF I PROPERTY STICKERS"" or by SKU# ""11244000"" and select ADD TO CART. Click the cart icon in the upper right-hand corner to view and edit. Once the desired quantity is entered, select CHECKOUT and then select Place Order. If the order was placed using the iStores catalog in iBuy, the cart will transfer into iBuy for completion once Place Order is selected. Quasi-Depreciation Calculation Property Accounting determined a reasonable useful life (in years) based on the item’s commodity code and asset description. The acquisition cost was then divided by the useful life to arrive at an annual depreciation expense. The age of each Ptag was determined by counting the number of years that passed since the Ptag Date to April 1, 2023. Accumulated depreciation was then calculated by taking the number of years passed x annual depreciation expense. Net Book Value was then calculated by taking the Acquisition Cost – Accumulated Depreciation. If the Net Book Value was below $2,500, it was removal. Any asset that was older than its determined useful life did not have a calculation done as those were assumed to be fully depreciated. Additionally, any asset less than 3 years old was not included in the list for removal. Data-wiping of Electronics & Equipment Disposals University units must continue to data-wipe all electronics and include scrap labels on wiped electronics regardless of the item’s inventory tracking status. University units must continue to request disposal of all University equipment through FABweb and equipment must continue to be sent to the University surplus warehouse for scrap or surplus processing regardless of the item’s inventory tracking status. Unit Tracked Equipment University policy 12.1.6 Affix Property Labels prohibits the use of the University Ptag labels to identify items not tracked on the University Inventory. This is to avoid confusion on what items are actually required to be tracked. There may be individual items or categories of items that a University unit desires to track for internal control purposes. For units desiring to track equipment outside of Banner, units must create labels and identifiers that differentiate any unit tracked equipment from University tracked equipment. To assist, University best practice suggests tracking unit items starting with a “U” for Unit tracked; followed by your campus and org number “1641”; followed by your unit unique identifier. For example, the unit tag for item #1 for org 641 at UIUC would be “U1641000001”. See ""Unit tracked equipment label template"" under ""Related Links"" on the right-hand side of this and other Equipment Management webpages.

To properly manage sponsor funded or furnished equipment the unit, the institution’s Sponsored Program Office and University Property Accounting and Reporting (UPAR) work in collaboration to ensure compliance. Below is an overview of important topics to understand and consider: Vesting of Title It is important to identify the ultimate holder of the equipment/property. In most cases sponsors will vest title of acquired equipment to the University. Due to the University being identified as a component of the State of Illinois, the title will vest to the State of Illinois. Oftentimes, equipment purchased on Federal contracts, the government will retain title. When identified, the unit should contact your institution’s Sponsored Program Office to obtain a Federal Government tag. In instances where a private sponsor retains title, obtain a sponsor provided inventory tag from your Sponsored Program Office. Banner Fixed Asset Record When title does not vest to the State, the unit will need to notify UPAR of these situations so the inventory records can be appropriately updated to reflect correct title information. Identity of equipment Equipment that is titled to a sponsor or Federal Government may not become a fixture or lose its identity or personality by incorporation into or attachment to property not owned by the same sponsor or university titled equipment/property. Periodic verification Per Uniform Guidance , all Federal acquired equipment, whether government title or titled to the State of IL, is subject to physical inspection. Equipment that is held under agreements with sponsoring agencies or is on loan from outside agencies is included in the monthly and annual reports received by units and is verified under the same procedures as is State-owned equipment. Biennial Inventory serves as the University’s internal control for compliance with the above regulation. Records of sponsor furnished or loaned equipment Property records for movable equipment furnished or loaned to the system for use on a research project or for other purposes should be kept in Banner Fixed Asset. The records identify the equipment as non-State titled property. Work with UPAR to create a property record. Transfer of equipment from the U of I System Equipment purchased from sponsored project funds may be transferred to another institution of higher education under certain circumstances. See Business and Finance Policies and Procedures . Loans of Sponsored Project Equipment Under certain circumstances, equipment acquired with sponsored project funds may be loaned to other institutions of higher education for continuation of the sponsored research. Contact UPAR to initiate this process. See Business and Finance Policies for more information. Transfer or Loans of equipment to the U of I System All movable equipment held under agreements with sponsoring agencies remains the property of the sponsoring agency until the equipment is transferred to the system under one of the following conditions: As part of the sponsor's agreement. At the request of the system via a disposition request and the written approval of the sponsor.

This type of transfer is called an Interdepartmental Transfer, and it can be done as either a straightforward transfer or as a ""sale"" from one department to the other. In both cases, the transfer of custody is done via FABweb. However, for “sales” from one department to another, the sale part of the transfer is done outside of FABweb. If equipment held by one department can be used by another department, and there is a mutual agreement for the receiving department to pay for the equipment, a transfer ""sale"" transaction can be made between the two departments. The ""sale"" is usually accomplished via a budget transfer from the receiving department to the originating department, for the agreed-upon amount. Only certain types of budget or funding transfers are allowed to compensate for the equipment. Check with your business office if you have any questions about allowable funding transfers. Loans Whether it's a computer being loaned to a staff member for a week or lab equipment being loaned to another institution for two years, it is important to follow the established policies and procedures for equipment loans to ensure the loan terms are clearly documented. Units may loan equipment to faculty and staff or students to support the mission of the University of Illinois System. Faculty, staff, or students who have been loaned equipment are responsible for its safe keeping. The unit head retains custodial responsibility for any loaned equipment. Units are encouraged to share equipment. When equipment is loaned to another unit for more than one academic session, the unit must report this to University Property Accounting and Reporting. Equipment acquired with restricted, sponsored project funds may be loaned to another institution for a limited period under the specific circumstances outlined in Policy 12.3.6 .

Scrap and surplus equipment must go to a campus redistribution warehouse. It cannot be disposed of by any other method, such as throwing in the garbage/dumpster, selling, or giving away. If equipment is broken (scrap) or functioning but no longer needed (surplus), a FABweb Surplus/Disposal request should be submitted by the unit. The disposal process involves the following: The Unit Representative prepares the scrap/surplus request in FABweb. The Unit Approver reviews and submits the request to Property Accounting in FABweb. Property Accounting will review and approve the request and send their approval via email to the Unit Representative or will decline the request in FABweb if there are issues with the request. Each campus warehouse has a different equipment delivery procedure. See the Business and Finance Policies and Procedures Manual, 12.4.3 Dispose of Unneeded Equipment . For more information on disposals, see the OBFS Policies and Procedures Manual, 12 Property Accounting or if you have questions, contact University Property Accounting Reporting (UPAR) at obfsuafrproperty@uillinois.edu . Equipment Disposal Procedures All Banner (inventoried) and non-Banner (non-inventoried) equipment, regardless of cost or condition must be recorded using the FABweb Surplus/Disposal request. In addition to the general scrap/surplus procedure, each university within the U of I System has their own disposal process and information. Check university-specific procedures before initiating a disposal. Federally Titled and Other Titled equipment cannot be disposed of without approval from the appropriate Sponsored Programs office before submission. Check for university-specific disposal procedures before proceeding. Other Disposal Situations Other disposal situations that must be reported using the FABweb Surplus/Disposal request form include: Artwork and Antiques Special rules apply to the disposal of antiques and art, please reach out to UPAR for details. Casualty Loss (Fire/Flood Damage) If equipment is destroyed or irreparably damaged through fire, flood, or accident, it is considered a casualty loss. Disposed without UPAR Approval Item has already been scrapped by the department, without going through the proper disposal process with UPAR approval, and a responsible individual within the department has personal knowledge of its unauthorized disposal and can attest to the nature of the disposition. Firearms A department should trade in firearms that are no longer needed for other firearms, given that the vendor provides adequate documentation of old weapon(s). Hazardous Materials Disposal of hazardous materials is university specific. Please follow all applicable procedures for your university. Inventoried in Error Any item that was added to inventory, but does not qualify as equipment, for which a Journal Voucher (JV) has been prepared to correct the Account code. Please provide the JV # in the Comments/Notes field. Returned for Credit Item has been returned to vendor. State Surplus Equipment that is shipped directly to CMS. Prior UPAR approval is required. Stolen Units must immediately report stolen equipment to the police and provide them with a complete description of the equipment, including the property control (PTag) number and the manufacturer's serial number. The sponsoring agency may require restitution for unlocatable or damaged equipment acquired with grant and contract funds. Trade-In Any item that was traded-in on the acquisition of equipment. The Purchase Order number and the Permanent Tag (PTag) of the newly acquired equipment must be provided in the comments section. In addition, you must add the old equipment’s PTag number to the new equipment’s asset record, in the External Cross Ref field. Transfer Out Equipment that is sent to other agencies. Prior UPAR approval and documentation are required, see “Special Exemption Requests” below. Transfer with Researcher Prior UPAR approval and documentation are required, see “Special Exemption Requests” below. Special Exemption Requests for Disposals If a department believes that it has a justifiable reason to dispose of equipment in a way which does not conform to State and U of I System guidelines (such as donating equipment or selling it and retaining the proceeds), approval must be obtained from Central Management Services (CMS) before disposal. The department should prepare a written justification explaining why they should receive an exemption from the State Property Control Act and submit that to UPAR. UPAR uses the department justification to draft and send a formal exemption request to CMS. CMS has 30 days to approve or deny the request. For information or to pursue a special exemption request from CMS, contact Magdalena Jach, Property Accounting Surplus Coordinator, at mj20@uillinois.edu Stolen Equipment Department heads are responsible for determining if restitution is appropriate from an individual stolen equipment. Equipment Loan forms are required when individuals borrow or take custody of equipment outside of U of I System premises. Individuals may also be asked to reimburse the System if: Equipment was misplaced or damaged because of neglect while in their care, or U of I System property was used without being granted explicit or implicit departmental knowledge or authorization. Suggestions for Maintaining Security over Property The following are suggestions for maintaining security over U of I System property to reduce the risk of lost or stolen equipment: Avoid leaving offices or laboratories unlocked while unattended Lock small and valuable equipment in cabinets and drawers when not in use Keep a record of description, serial number and custodian of non-inventoried equipment within the unit Avoid leaving equipment deliveries/pick-ups on unsecured docks and receiving rooms Presumed Disposal Situations Presumed disposal situations must be reported using the FAbweb Surplus/Disposal request for inventory equipment items that cannot be located after a thorough search during biennial inventory. These include the following: Presume scrap without authorization (Biennial Inventory) If an item of equipment cannot be found after a thorough search, such as during biennial inventory, it is considered unlocatable. Unlocatable equipment must be resolved. Presumed other disposal To be used after a thorough search when the likely disposition was a casualty loss, inventoried in error, returned for credit, state surplus, stolen, trade-in, transferred out, transferred w/researcher, or unique case. Data Elimination from Computers The Data Security on State Computers Act mandates the elimination of data from computer storage devices prior to disposal. Data elimination requirements may also apply when transferring equipment to another institution. See the following University policies and guidelines for compliance: UIUC : Security Compliance, Electronic Data, Disk, SSD, or Other Storage Device Disposal UIC : Hard Drive Policy UIS : UIS IT Policies, Procedures & Guidelines For additional information on data elimination, see the Business and Financial Policies and Procedures Manual, 12.4.5 Remove Data from Electronic Devices .

Therefore, balances of open accounts must have a provision for uncollectibility to estimate how much of those balances will actually be received. Under generally accepted accounting principles, this is accomplished by establishing an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables (an offsetting, “contra-asset” account) that creates an allowance “reserve” which nets against total accounts receivable. The net of total accounts receivable less the allowance reserve balance results in a more realistic value of the asset. The allowance is estimated annually at the end of the fiscal year at the Detail code level by University Bursar Business Operations (BO). The allowance for uncollectible accounts is calculated by multiplying the receivable balance in the various aging “buckets” (see table below) by a reserve rate. A higher reserve rate is applied to older receivables because the receivables are less likely to be collected. For example, a $100 receivable 366 or more days old is reserved at 95%. Therefore, $95 is credited to the allowance account (53099) in the general ledger. The offsetting entry is a $95 charge to bad debt expense account (186100) in the operating ledger. As the dollar amount of receivables increases or decreases each year for each Detail code, the corresponding allowance and bad debt expense are adjusted accordingly. In addition, the rates used in the allowance calculation are likewise reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary. Examples of reserve rates by aging bucket are shown below: Current Due 1-30 Days 31-90 Days 91-180 Days 181-365 Days 366+ Days 0.25% 1.25% 5% 10% 35% 95% Build an allowance for uncollectible accounts into your pricing structure by factoring the above calculation into the price you set for the good or service provided. For assistance in calculating your allowance, contact University Bursar BO at 312-413-5950. Collecting Delinquent Accounts University Bursar ensures that all delinquent accounts in Banner AR are managed in compliance with all pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. University Bursar maximizes account recovery while providing excellent customer service through the use of internal collectors and third party collection agencies. University Bursar performs the following activity on all delinquent GAR and SAR accounts in Banner AR: Assess monthly late payment charges in the amount of 1.5% or $1.00, whichever is greater, per month on all invoices that are 30 days or more past due. Assess a monthly past due charge in the amount of $2 on all accounts that are 60 days or more past due. Begin internal collection activity on all accounts that are 30 days past due. Internal collection activity includes: A series of emailed (or mailed in the absence of a valid email address) past due notices and phone calls made to the customer with the goal of collecting payment in full or initiating a payment plan. Skip tracing to locate valid addresses and phone numbers. Placement with the Illinois Comptroller’s State Offset System at 90 days delinquent when the account balance is $500 or more. Accounts placed with the State Offset System intercepts Illinois wages, state tax refunds, lottery winnings, and other state payments. Departments are required to assist with request from the collection office this includes invoice request and dispute resolution. If internal collection activity is unsuccessful after 180 days, accounts are consecutively placed with up to three third party collection agencies. Third party collection activity includes: A series of mailed past due notices and phone calls made to the customer. Skip tracing to locate valid addresses and phone numbers. Closing and returning all uncollected accounts to University Bursar within one year. University Bursar places returned first placement accounts with a different agency as second placements. Second placement agencies perform the same activity as first placements. This process continues till the account is returned from a third placement at that point the account is written off.

In order to use this report, the Detail Code(s) associated with the C-FOAP, AR Rule Code1 and the Feeder Document number/s are required. If these are not known, they can be determined by using the crosswalk files available on this page. This is recognized by the Rule Code1 for the Related Detail Code. Determine Detail Code and Rule Code 1 If the Detail Code(s) related transactions to be analyzed are unknown retrieve the crosswalk workbook for the term that corresponds to the finance period in question and determine the particular Detail Code(s). To use that workbook, see the related reference at C-FOAP to Detail Code Crosswalk. Record the related Detail Code/s and Rule Code 1s. The Detail Code/s will be required in the prompts for the Eddie/Infoview/Business Objects report. The Rule Codes may be helpful in the analysis. In Eddie UI2 Finance reports select the report ""UR_FIAR_FIN_Ledgers_AR_Payment_Trans"" and refresh it. Using the prompts enter the Detail Codes and Document #s to be analyzed and run the report. The report will return a list of transactions, by AR account, which up make the amounts recorded in the ledger for the Detail Codes and Accounts. Only initial transactions from AR can be analyzed this way, not transactions resulting from multiple re-applications of payments. Initial transactions are indicated by the Ledger Transaction Listing RUCL corresponding to RUCL1 in the C-FOAP to Detail Code Crosswalk. C-FOAP to Detail Code Crosswalk For ledger reconciliation purposes and ledger account analysis units need to know what AR Detail Codes are associated with what Chart, Fund, Organization, Account and Program (Fund and Account for GL transactions only). Banner and the EDW do not provide a means for the general user to accomplish this so University Bursar posts an Excel Workbook that enables units to crosswalk C-FOAPs to Detail Codes. Since the FOAPS behind term based detail codes can change with term updates, this crosswalk will be posted for the current and past academic year. It is updated and posted daily to currently reflect any additions or changes. Any of the xWalks will return the correct C-FOAP for non-term based detail codes. Until familiar with Term Based usage and changing C-FOAPs check term based codes for multiple terms to be sure of correct C-FOAP for a given FY, Period, account reconciliation or analysis. If the Detail Code/s related transactions to be analyzed are unknown retrieve the crosswalk workbook for the term that corresponds to the finance period in question and determine the particular Detail Codes. To use that work book see the related reference at Reconcile AR Transactions Ledgers to Accounts Receivable Record the related Detail Code/s and Rule Code 1s. The Detail Code/s will be required in the prompts for the Eddie/Infoview/Business Objects report. The Rule Codes may be helpful in the analysis.

The U of I System adopts a decentralized approach to cash handling, delegating responsibilities extensively to enhance operational efficiency, convenience, and flexibility. The ultimate responsibility for the cash handling function lies with the Vice President/Chief Financial Officer and Comptroller. Delegations extend to units not under the direct control of the Vice President. Effective delegation relies on vigilant supervision by unit managers. Adequate internal controls play a pivotal role in ensuring responsible stewardship of public funds and safeguarding employees. The cash handling function encompasses two main areas: Cash Collections Involves the collection, control, and deposit of amounts owed to the U of I System from cash sales, accounts receivable collections, credit card sales, and other sources. Cash Disbursement Encompasses the dispensing of cash (both currency and checks) for miscellaneous expenditures and the control of funds designated for this purpose. Unit Heads play a pivotal role in ensuring the secure and accountable management of cash within their respective units.
